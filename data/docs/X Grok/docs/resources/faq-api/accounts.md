# Accounts

## How do I create an account for the API?

You can create an account at https://accounts.x.ai, or https://console.x.ai. To link your X account automatically to
your xAI account, choose to sign up with X account.

You can create multiple accounts of different sign-in methods with the same email.

When you sign-up with a sign-in method and with the same email, we will prompt you whether you
want to create a new account, or link to the existing account. We will not be able to merge the
content, subscriptions, etc. of different accounts.

## How do I update my xAI account email?

You can visit [xAI Accounts](https://accounts.x.ai). On the Account page, you can update your email.

## How do I add other sign-in methods?

Once you have signed-up for an account, you can add additional sign-in methods by going to [xAI Accounts](https://accounts.x.ai).

## I've forgotten my Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) method, can you remove it?

You can generate your recovery codes at [xAI Accounts](https://accounts.x.ai) Security page.

We can't remove or reset your MFA method unless you have recovery codes due to security considerations. Please reach out to support@x.ai if you would like to delete the account instead.

## If I already have an account for Grok, can I use the same account for API access?

Yes, the account is shared between Grok and xAI API. You can manage the sign-in details at https://accounts.x.ai.

However, the billing is separate for Grok and xAI API. You can manage your billing for xAI API on [xAI Console](https://console.x.ai).
To manage billing for Grok, visit https://grok.com -> Settings -> Billing, or directly with Apple/Google if you made the
purchase via Apple App Store or Google Play.

## How do I manage my account?

You can visit [xAI Accounts](https://accounts.x.ai) to manage your account.

Please note the xAI account is different from the X account, and xAI cannot assist you with X account issues. Please
contact X via [X Help Center](https://help.x.com/) or Premium Support if you encounters any issues with your X account.

## How do I delete my xAI account?

We are sorry to see you go!

You can visit [xAI Accounts](https://accounts.x.ai/account) to delete your account. You can restore your account after log in again and confirming restoration within 30 days.

You can cancel the deletion within 30 days by logging in again to any xAI websites and follow the prompt to confirm restoring the account.
