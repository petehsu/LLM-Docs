# FIM Completion (Beta)

In [FIM (Fill In the Middle) completion](</api/create-completion>), users can provide a prefix and a suffix (optional), and the model will complete the content in between. FIM is commonly used for content completion、code completion.

## Notice​

  1. The max tokens of FIM completion is 4K.
  2. The user needs to set `base_url=https://api.deepseek.com/beta` to enable the Beta feature.

## Sample Code​

Below is a complete Python code example for FIM completion. In this example, we provide the beginning and the end of a function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence, allowing the model to complete the content in the middle.
    
    
    from openai import OpenAI  
      
    client = OpenAI(  
        api_key="<your api key>",  
        base_url="https://api.deepseek.com/beta",  
    )  
      
    response = client.completions.create(  
        model="deepseek-chat",  
        prompt="def fib(a):",  
        suffix="    return fib(a-1) + fib(a-2)",  
        max_tokens=128  
    )  
    print(response.choices[0].text)  
    

## Integration With Continue​

[Continue](<https://continue.dev>) is a VSCode plugin that supports code completion. You can refer to [this document](<https://github.com/deepseek-ai/awesome-deepseek-integration/blob/main/docs/continue/README_cn.md>) to configure Continue for using the code completion feature.
