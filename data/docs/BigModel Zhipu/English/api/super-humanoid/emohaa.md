## **SSE Invocation**

**API Request**

| Transmission Method | https |
| --- | --- |
| Request URL | `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4/chat/completions` |
| Calling Method | Synchronous call, wait for the model to execute and return the final result or SSE call |
| Character Encoding | UTF-8 |
| Request Format | JSON |
| Response Format | JSON or Standard Stream Event |
| Request Type | POST |
| Development Language | Any development language capable of making HTTP requests |

### **Request Parameters**

| Parameter Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| model | String | Yes | The model code to be called. |
| messages | List<Object> | Yes | When calling the language model, input the current conversation information list as prompts to the model in the form of a JSON array like `{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}`. Possible message types include User message and Assistant message. |
| meta | Object | Yes | Role and user information data, including user\_info: user information, bot\_info: role information, bot\_name: role name, user\_name: user name. |
| user\_info | String | Yes | User information. |
| bot\_info | String | Yes | Role information. |
| bot\_name | String | Yes | Role name. |
| user\_name | String | Yes | User name. |
| request\_id | String | No | A unique identifier for each request, provided by the client side to distinguish each request. If not provided, the platform will generate it by default. |
| do\_sample | Boolean | No | When `do_sample` is true, the sampling strategy is enabled; when `do_sample` is false, the sampling strategy parameters such as `temperature`, `top_p` will not take effect. |
| stream | Boolean | No | Should be set to False or omitted for synchronous calls. If set to True, the model returns content in chunks through a standard Event Stream. The Event Stream ends with a `data: [DONE]` message. |
| temperature | Float | No | Sampling temperature, controlling the randomness of output. Must be a positive number. Valid range: (0.0, 1.0], cannot be 0. A higher value increases randomness and creativity; a lower value makes output more stable or predictable. Adjust according to application scenario. |
| top\_p | Float | No | Another method of sampling, called nucleus sampling. Valid range: (0.0, 1.0) open interval, cannot be 0 or 1, default is 0.7. The model considers results within the top\_p probability mass of tokens. For example, 0.1 means the decoder considers tokens from the top 10% of candidates. Adjust according to application scenario. |
| max\_tokens | Integer | No | The maximum number of tokens the model can output. |
| stop | List | No | The model stops generating when it encounters the specified stop character(s); currently only supports a single stop word, formatted as [“stop\_word1”]. |
| user\_id | String | No | Unique ID of the end user, helping the platform to intervene in the end user’s illegal activities, generation of illegal and inappropriate information, or other abusive behavior. ID length requirement: at least 6 characters, maximum of 128 characters. Learn more |

### Messages Field Description

1. User message

| Parameter Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| role | String | Yes | The role of the message, should be “user” in this case. |
| content | String | Yes | The content of the message. |

1. Assistant message

| Parameter Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| role | String | Yes | The role of the message, should be “assistant” in this case. |
