# Web Search in Chat

提示

Search-Std (ZhiPu Self-developed Basic Search Version) will be offered for free until May 31, 2025. Starting from 0:00 on June 1, 2025, the price will be adjusted to 0.01 yuan per search.

Web Search in Chat allows the invocation of search engines within the Completions interface, combining real-time web retrieval results with the generative capabilities of large models (GLM) to provide up-to-date and verifiable responses.

#### **Interface Request**

| Transmission Method | https |
| --- | --- |
| Request URL | https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4/chat/completions |
| Invocation Method | Synchronous call, waiting for the model to complete execution and return the final result, or SSE call |
| Character Encoding | UTF-8 |
| Request Format | JSON |
| Response Format | JSON or standard Stream Event |
| Request Type | POST |
| Development Language | Any language capable of initiating HTTP requests |

#### Request Parameters

| **Parameter Name** | **Type** | **Required** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **model** | String | Yes | Model identifier |
| **messages** | List<Object> | Yes | A list of conversation messages provided as input to the model, formatted as a JSON array like `{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}`. Possible message types include System message, User message, and Assistant message. |
| **request\_id** | String | No | A unique identifier provided by the client. If not provided, the platform will generate one by default. |
| **do\_sample** | Boolean | No | If `true`, sampling strategies are enabled. If `false`, sampling parameters like `temperature` and `top_p` will not take effect. Default is `true`. |
| **stream** | Boolean | No | For synchronous calls, this should be `false` or omitted, meaning the model returns all content at once after generation. Default is `false`. If `true`, the model will return content incrementally via standard Event Stream, ending with `data: [DONE]`. Note: During streaming, if inappropriate content is detected (error code 1301), developers should take measures (e.g., clearing the screen or restarting the conversation) to remove the content and prevent further generation. |
| **temperature** | Float | No | Sampling temperature, controlling output randomness. Must be positive, within `(0.0, 1.0)`. Default is `0.95`. Higher values increase randomness and creativity; lower values make output more stable. Adjust either `top_p` or `temperature`, but not both. |
| **top\_p** | Float | No | An alternative to temperature sampling (nucleus sampling). Range: `(0.0, 1.0)`, default `0.7`. The model considers tokens with the top `top_p` probability mass. For example, `0.1` means only the top 10% probability tokens are considered. Adjust either `top_p` or `temperature`, but not both. |
| **max\_tokens** | Integer | No | Maximum output tokens. Maximum is `8192`, default is `1024`. |
| **stop** | List | No | Stops generation when encountering specified tokens. Recommended: `["< |
| **tools** | List | No | Tools the model can invoke. |
| **type** | String | Yes | **web\_search**: An object describing web search settings. If `tools` includes `type: retrieval`, `web_search` will not take effect.    **enable:** `Boolean` (optional): Enables web search. Default is `False`.    **search\_engine:** `String` (required): Specifies the search engine type. Default is `search_std`. Supported values: `search_std`, `search_pro`, `search_pro_sogou`, `search_pro_quark`.   -**count**: `Int` (non-required), the number of returned results. The fillable range is 1-50, with a maximum of 50 results returned in a single search, and the default is 10. Supported search engines: `search_std`、 `search_pro`、`search_pro_sogou`, . Among them, the optional enumerated values for `search_pro_sogou` are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50.   -**search\_domain\_filter**: `String` (non-required), used to limit the scope of search results and only return content from specified whitelist domains, where the whitelist needs to directly input domain names (such as `www.example.com`). Supported search engines: `search_std`, `search_pro`、`search_pro_sogou`   -**search\_recency\_filter**: `String` (non-required). Search for web pages within a specified time range. The default is `noLimit`, and the fillable values are: `oneDay` (within one day), `oneWeek` (within one week), `oneMonth` (within one month), `oneYear` (within one year), `noLimit` (no limit). Supported search engines: `search_std`、`search_pro`、`search_pro_sogou`、`search_pro_quark`,   -**content\_size**: `String` (non-required). Control the number of words in the web page summary; the default value is `medium`. Optional parameters: `medium` (balanced mode, suitable for most queries, 400-600 words); `high` (maximize the context to provide a more comprehensive answer, but with higher costs, 2500 words).    **search\_prompt:** `String` (optional): Custom prompt for search results. The default Prompt is:   ``` You are an intelligent Q&A expert capable of integrating information, performing time recognition, semantic understanding, and contradictory information cleansing. The current date is {{current_date}}. Using this as the sole reference point,  please comprehensively and accurately answer the user’s question based on the following information. Extract only valuable content for responses, ensuring answers are timely and authoritative.  State answers directly without explaining data sources or internal processing procedures. ```  **search\_query:** `String` (optional): Forces a custom search query.    **search\_result:** `Boolean` (optional): Whether to require search results before answering. Default is `false`.    **result\_sequence:** `String` (optional): Specifies whether search results appear before or after the model’s reply. Default is `after`. Supported values: `before`, `after`. |

    "choices": [
        {

            "index": 0,
            "message": {
                "content": "As of my last update, I cannot predict specific financial events for April 2025, as financial markets are influenced by numerous unpredictable factors such as economic indicators, policy decisions, corporate earnings, and global events. However, I can suggest some types of events that typically occur in any given April that could be important from a financial perspective:\n\n1. **Economic Indicator Releases**: Many countries release key economic indicators such as GDP growth rates, unemployment rates, inflation figures, and consumer spending reports in April. These can significantly impact the financial markets.\n\n2. **Corporate Earnings Reports**: The first quarter of the year ends in March, and many companies release their earnings reports in April. These reports can have a substantial impact on stock prices.\n\n3. **Tax Deadlines**: In the United States, the tax deadline for individuals is typically April 15 (or the following Monday if the 15th is a weekend). This can lead to increased financial activity as people file their taxes and make investments to manage their tax liability.\n\n4. **Central Bank Meetings**: Central banks around the world may hold policy meetings in April. Decisions on interest rates or other monetary policy measures can have wide-ranging effects on financial markets.\n\n5. **Seasonal Economic Trends**: Spring can bring about seasonal trends such as increased consumer spending or housing activity, which can influence economic growth and financial markets.\n\n6. **Geopolitical Events**: Decisions or events related to trade agreements, sanctions, or international disputes can impact global markets.\n\n7. **Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)**: Companies may choose to go public in April, leading to significant market interest and potential investment opportunities.\n\n8. **Major Economic Conferences**: There could be significant economic conferences or summits in April that bring together global leaders and can lead to policy announcements or shifts.\n\nFor precise events and their implications, you would need to follow financial news sources closer to the date. Economic calendars, which are published by financial news websites and financial market data providers, can give you a detailed view of the expected financial events for any given month.",
