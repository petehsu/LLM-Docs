### Response Example

```
Completion(model='glm-z1-airx', created=1744623134, choices=[CompletionChoice(index=0, finish_reason='stop', message=CompletionMessage(content='\n<think>\nHmm, the problem I need to solve is: A bag contains 5 red balls and 3 blue balls. If 2 balls are drawn at random, what is the probability of drawing at least 1 red ball? Okay, first I need to understand the problem clearly, possibly using basic probability principles or combinatorics.\n\nFirst, the bag has 5 red and 3 blue balls, so there are 5+3=8 balls in total. I need to draw 2 balls and find the probability of drawing at least 1 red ball. Here, "at least one" can usually be calculated in two ways: either directly calculate the probability of all qualifying cases, or calculate the probability of its complement, which is 1 minus the probability of the non-qualifying case. The latter might be simpler because the complement of "at least one red ball" is "no red balls," meaning both balls are blue.\n\nLet me try the complement method first. The complement probability is the probability of drawing two blue balls, and then subtracting this from 1 gives the probability of at least one red ball.\n\nFirst, calculate the probability of drawing two blue balls. There are 3 blue balls, so the probability of drawing the first blue ball is 3/8. After drawing one blue ball, there are 2 blue balls left out of 7 total balls, so the probability of drawing the second blue ball is 2/7. Thus, the probability of drawing two blue balls in succession is 3/8 * 2/7 = (3×2)/(8×7)=6/56=3/28.\n\nThen, the complement probability is 1 minus this value, i.e., 1 - 3/28 = 25/28. So, the probability of drawing at least one red ball should be 25/28. But I need to verify if this is correct or if there’s another method to ensure the answer is right.\n\nAnother method is to directly calculate the cases of at least one red ball, i.e., drawing 1 red and 1 blue ball or drawing 2 red balls, and then summing their probabilities.\n\nFirst, calculate the probability of drawing 1 red and 1 blue ball. There are 5 red and 3 blue balls, so the number of ways to draw 1 red and 1 blue is C(5,1)×C(3,1), which is 5×3=15 combinations. The total number of ways to draw 2 balls is C(8,2)=28. So, the probability of this case is 15/28.\n\nNext, calculate the probability of drawing 2 red balls. There are 5 red balls, so the number of ways to draw 2 red balls is C(5,2)=10. The total number of ways is still 28, so the probability is 10/28=5/14.\n\nThen, sum the probabilities of these two cases to get the probability of at least one red ball: 15/28 + 5/14. Note that 5/14 equals 10/28, so the sum is 15/28 + 10/28=25/28, which matches the result from the complement method. This confirms both methods yield the same result, so the answer should be 25/28.\n\nBut I’ll double-check the calculations to ensure no mistakes were made. For example, in the complement method, the first draw is 3/8, the second is 2/7, so the product is indeed 6/56=3/28, correct. Then the complement is 1-3/28=25/28, correct. In the direct method, 1 red and 1 blue is 5×3=15, correct, total ways are C(8,2)=28, correct, so 15/28. 2 red balls is C(5,2)=10, correct, so 10/28=5/14, sum is 25/28, correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could enumerate all possible cases, though for 8 balls it might be tedious, but perhaps simplified. Suppose the bag has 5 red balls (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5) and 3 blue balls (B1, B2, B3), then all possible ways to draw 2 balls are C(8,2)=28. Now count the cases with at least one red ball.\n\nThere are 28 total cases, of which only C(3,2)=3 are two blue balls: B1B2, B1B3, B2B3. So, the remaining 28-3=25 cases have at least one red ball. Thus, the probability is 25/28, matching previous results.\n\nSo, whether using the complement method, direct calculation, or enumeration, the result is 25/28, so this answer should be correct.\n\nTo summarize:\n1. Determine the total number of balls and drawing method: 8 balls, drawing 2 without replacement.\n2. Calculate the complement event (two blue balls): C(3,2)/C(8,2)=3/28.\n3. Subtract from 1 to get the probability of at least one red ball: 1 - 3/28 = 25/28.\n4. Verify: Directly calculate the sum of probabilities for 1 red + 1 blue and 2 red balls, results match.\n5. Further verify: Enumerate all cases, confirm the result.\n\nThus, the final answer is 25/28.\n\n**Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{28}}\n</think>\nFirst, the bag has 5 red and 3 blue balls, totaling 8 balls. We need to calculate the probability of drawing at least 1 red ball when drawing 2 balls at random.\n\nWe can use the complement method. The complement event is drawing two blue balls, calculated as:\n- First draw: blue probability is 3/8.\n- Second draw: blue probability is 2/7 (since one blue ball has been drawn).\n- Thus, the probability of two blue balls is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{3}{8} \\times \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{6}{56} = \\frac{3}{28}\n  \\]\n\nThen, the probability of at least one red ball is 1 minus the complement probability:\n  \\[\n  1 - \\frac{3}{28} = \\frac{25}{28}\n  \\]\n\nWe can also verify by directly summing the probabilities of two cases:\n1. Drawing 1 red and 1 blue ball:\n   - Number of ways: C(5,1) × C(3,1) = 5 × 3 = 15.\n   - Total ways: C(8,2) = 28.\n   - Probability: 15/28.\n\n2. Drawing 2 red balls:\n   - Number of ways: C(5,2) = 10.\n   - Probability: 10/28 = 5/14.\n\nSumming the probabilities: 15/28 + 5/14 = 15/28 + 10/28 = 25/28.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming the answer is correct.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{28}}\n\\]', role='assistant', tool_calls=None))], request_id='20250414173205c954d6f87ff8438c', id='20250414173205c954d6f87ff8438c', usage=CompletionUsage(prompt_tokens=36, completion_tokens=1839, total_tokens=1875))

If 2 balls are drawn at random, what is the probability of drawing at least 1 red ball? I need to think carefully about how to solve this.\n\nFirst, I should recall basic probability concepts. Probability problems are usually solved by calculating the number of successful events divided by the total number of possible events. However, sometimes direct calculation can be cumbersome, especially when the problem involves "at least one" scenarios. In such cases, the complement method can be used—calculating the probability of the non-qualifying event and subtracting it from 1 to get the desired probability.\n\nIn this problem, the complement of "at least 1 red ball" is "no red balls," meaning both balls drawn are blue. Thus, calculating the probability of drawing two blue balls and subtracting it from 1 should give the probability of at least one red ball.\n\nBut to confirm my approach, I can try two methods: directly calculating the probability of at least one red ball and using the complement method, then comparing the results.\n\nFirst, the complement method:\n\nThere are 3 blue balls. The probability of drawing two blue balls is C(3,2) divided by C(8,2). Calculating:\n\nC(3,2) = 3! / (2! * (3-2)!) = 3 / 2 = 3 (Is this correct? C(3,2) is the number of ways to choose 2 blue balls from 3, which is 3: B1B2, B1B3, B2B3.)\n\nC(8,2) = 8! / (2! * 6!) = (8*7)/2 = 28.\n\nThus, the probability of two blue balls is 3/28, and the probability of at least one red ball is 1 - 3/28 = 25/28. Right?\n\nTo confirm, I can directly calculate the probability of at least one red ball. This includes two cases: drawing 1 red and 1 blue ball or drawing 2 red balls.\n\nFirst, calculate the probability of 1 red and 1 blue: C(5,1)*C(3,1) / C(8,2) = (5*3)/28 = 15/28.\n\nThen, calculate the probability of 2 red balls: C(5,2)/C(8,2) = 10/28 = 5/14.\n\nSumming these: 15/28 + 5/14 = 15/28 + 10/28 = 25/28, matching the complement method result. Both methods agree, so the answer is 25/28.\n\nBut I’ll double-check the calculations to ensure no mistakes. For the complement method, C(3,2)=3, correct. C(8,2)=28, correct. So 3/28, complement is 25/28, correct.\n\nDirect calculation: 1 red and 1 blue is 5×3=15, correct; total ways are 28, so 15/28. 2 red balls is C(5,2)=10, so 10/28=5/14, sum is 25/28, correct.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, so the answer is 25/28.\n\nAlternatively, I could enumerate all possible cases, though for 8 balls it might be tedious. Suppose the bag has 5 red balls (R1-R5) and 3 blue balls (B1-B3), then all possible ways to draw 2 balls are C(8,2)=28. The number of cases with at least one red ball is 28 - C(3,2)=28-3=25. Thus, the probability is 25/28, confirming the result.\n\nIn summary:\n1. Total balls and drawing method: 8 balls, drawing 2 without replacement.\n2. Complement event (two blue balls): C(3,2)/C(8,2)=3/28.\n3. Probability of at least one red ball: 1 - 3/28 = 25/28.\n4. Verification: Directly sum probabilities for 1 red + 1 blue and 2 red balls, results match.\n5. Further verification: Enumerate all cases, confirm result.\n\nThus, the final answer is 25/28.\n\n**Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{28}}\n</think>\nFirst, the bag has 5 red and 3 blue balls, totaling 8 balls. We need to calculate the probability of drawing at least 1 red ball when drawing 2 balls at random.\n\nWe can use the complement method. The complement event is drawing two blue balls, calculated as:\n1. Number of ways to draw 2 blue balls from 3: C(3,2) = 3.\n2. Total ways to draw 2 balls from 8: C(8,2) = 28.\n3. Probability of two blue balls: 3/28.\n4. Thus, the probability of at least one red ball is: 1 - 3/28 = 25/28.\n\nTo verify, we can directly calculate the probability of at least one red ball:\n1. Drawing 1 red and 1 blue: C(5,1) × C(3,1) = 5 × 3 = 15 ways.\n2. Drawing 2 red balls: C(5,2) = 10 ways.\n3. Total qualifying cases: 15 + 10 = 25.\n4. Probability: 25/28.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming the answer is correct.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{28}}\n\\]', role='assistant', tool_calls=None))], usage=CompletionUsage(prompt_tokens=36, completion_tokens=1971, total_tokens=2007), created=1744623351)
