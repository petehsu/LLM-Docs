#### Example Response

```
Completion(model='glm-z1-air', created=1749458757,choices[CompletionChoice(index=0, 
finish_reason='stop',message=CompletionMessage(content='<think>\nOkay, so I need to 
create an opening script for a drama series about young entrepreneurs and their 
emotional lives. Let\'s start by breaking down the user\'s requirements. They want 
two episodes, first and second, covering both the business struggles and the 
emotional entanglements. Also, need to include 2024-2025 trends. \n\nFirst, the 
main characters. The user mentioned a group of young people, so maybe a core team 
of 4-5 characters with different backgrounds. Let\'s think about their roles. A 
tech visionary, maybe a finance person, a designer, and someone with a social media 
angle since that\'s a big trend. Names should be modern, maybe diverse.\n\nFor the 
business idea, something current. AI, sustainability, maybe a platform that 
combines both. Like an eco-friendly AI tool for small businesses. That\'s relevant 
now. The company name could be something catchy, like "EcoSphere Tech" or "GreenAI 
Labs."\n\nConflict design: The first episode could introduce their initial success, 
like a pitch competition win, but then a setback. Maybe a funding issue or a 
betrayal. Emotional conflicts could involve past relationships, current romances, 
or family pressures. \n\nScene transitions need to be smooth. Maybe start with a 
high-energy scene at a pitch event, then cut to their struggles. Use quick cuts to 
show the hustle. \n\nTrending elements for 2024-2025: AI advancements, remote work, 
mental health awareness, social justice, maybe something with cryptocurrency or 
Web3. Also, social media trends like TikTok challenges or viral moments. 
\n\nEpisode 1: Introduce the team, their product, the win at the pitch. Then 
introduce a conflict—maybe a betrayal by one of the members, or a technical glitch. 
Emotional angle: a romantic tension between two leads, maybe a past relationship 
resurfacing.\n\nEpisode 2: The fallout from the first episode\'s conflict. Maybe a 
funding loss, internal strife. Emotional entanglements escalate—affairs, secret 
agendas. Maybe introduce a new character or a venture capitalist with hidden 
motives. \n\nSocial issues: Mental health struggles, burnout, inequality in tech, 
sustainability vs. profit. \n\nDialogue should reflect their personalities. The 
tech guy is passionate but naive, the finance person is pragmatic, the designer is 
creative but anxious. \n\nNeed to ensure continuity between episodes. The conflict 
from Episode 1 should carry over, affecting their dynamics in Episode 2. Maybe end 
Episode 1 with a cliffhanger that sets up the next episode\'s challenges.\n\nAlso, 
think about visual elements. Episode 1 could have vibrant, fast-paced scenes 
showing their success, then darker tones as problems arise. Episode 2 might have 
more tense, claustrophobic settings as stress builds.\n\nIncorporate current tech 
trends: AI ethics, data privacy, maybe a subplot about a data breach or ethical 
dilemma. \n\nEmotional relationships: Maybe a love triangle, unrequited love, or a 
friend-to-lover situation. Family expectations vs. personal dreams, like a 
character pressured to join a family business instead of pursuing their 
startup.\n\nNeed to check if all these elements fit into two episodes without being 
too rushed. Balance between plot progression and character development. Each 
episode should end with a hook to keep viewers engaged.\n\nPossible titles for the 
series: "Founders & Frenemies" or "Startup Hearts." \n\nNow, structuring each 
episode. Episode 1: Introduction of characters, their product, the pitch win, then 
the inciting incident (betrayal or setback). Episode 2: Dealing with the 
consequences, internal conflicts, emotional peaks, and setup for future 
episodes.\n\nMake sure to include specific scenes that highlight both business and 
personal struggles. For example, a scene where they\'re working late on a project 
while dealing with a personal argument. Or a business meeting that turns into a 
confrontation about their values.\n\nAlso, think about music and tone. Episode 1 
might have an upbeat soundtrack, Episode 2 more tense and suspenseful.\n\nNeed to 
avoid clichés. Maybe the betrayal isn\'t just personal but also related to business 
ethics. Or the emotional conflict is tied to their professional 
choices.\n\nAlright, putting it all together into a script format with scene 
descriptions, dialogues, and transitions. Make sure each episode has a clear 
structure: setup, confrontation, resolution (or cliffhanger). Weave in the trending 
elements naturally, like a character using TikTok to promote their product, or 
discussing AI regulations.\n</think>\n**Title:** *Founders & Frenemies*  
\n**Genre:** Contemporary Drama/Entrepreneurial Thriller  \n**Season 1, Episodes 1–
2**  \n**Themes:** AI ethics, mental health in startups, sustainability vs. profit, 
nonbinary romance, generational wealth gaps.  \n\n---\n\n### **Episode 1: "The 
Pitch That Broke Us"**  \n**Cold Open (2:30):**  \n*Montage of chaotic startup life 
in 2024:*  \n- A viral TikTok dance challenge promoting a fictional app "EcoSwap" 
(trending #GreenRevolution2025).  \n- A tense boardroom scene: A hoodie-clad 
founder (LEO, 24) argues with a VC about carbon-neutral cloud servers.  \n- A 
cryptic text exchange: *"They’re stealing our code. Trust no one."*  \n- **Cut 
to:** A live pitch competition at a converted warehouse. The camera pans to four 
founders:  \n\n**Scene 1: The Dream Team**  \n*Stage: Neon-lit pitch venue. Judges 
(including a Gen Z billionaire and a TikTok-famous investor) scrutinize the panel.* 
 \n\n**LEO (CEO, AI Ethicist):**  \n*(nervous, gripping a prototype of "EcoSphere," 
 an AI tool that optimizes supply chains for small businesses)*  \n"Imagine a world 
 where your carbon footprint is your business’s *most* valuable asset. EcoSphere 
 doesn’t just track emissions—it *sells* them as NFTs to corporations. We’re 
 turning guilt into gold."  \n\n**JADE (COO, ex-consultant):**  \n*(smirking, 
 adjusts her necklace)*  \n"Or we’re turning our users into collateral. But 
 let’s not get philosophical. EcoSphere’s algorithm just secured a 30% efficiency 
 boost for a LA vegan startup. Revenue up 200% in six months."  \n\n**MIRA (CTO, 
 hacker prodigy):**  \n*(typing furiously on a holographic keyboard)*  
 \n"Correction: 320%. And our open-source model means *anyone* can adapt it. Profit 
 isn’t the enemy—it’s the engine."  \n\n**RYAN (CMO, former influencer):**  \n*
 (winking at the camera)*  \n"Pro tip: Tag #EcoSphereRevolution in your next post. 
 We’re giving away free API access to anyone who goes viral."  \n\n**Judge #1 (Gen 
 Z billionaire):**  \n"Love the hustle. But where’s the *heart*? How do you stop 
 your users from feeling exploited?"  \n\n*Silence. The team exchanges glances.*  
 \n\n**Scene 2: The Win (And The Worm)**  \n*EcoSphere wins $2M in seed funding. 
 The team celebrates with tequila shots.*  \n\n**JADE:**  \n*(to LEO)*  \n"Let’s 
 hire Mira’s brother, right? He’s a blockchain genius. Oh, and Ryan—book that SXSW 
 panel. We need media buzz."  \n\n**LEO:**  \n*(hesitant)*  \n"Jade, we can’t afford
 —"  \n\n**MIRA:**  \n*(interrupting)*  \n"Leo, he’s right. We’re burning cash. If 
 we don’t scale now—"  \n\n**RYAN:**  \n*(grinning)*  \n"Scale? Let’s *monetize*."  
 \n*(Pulls out a phone showing DMs from a crypto bro: "I’ll fund you if Jade sleeps 
 with me.")*  \n\n*The team freezes. Fade to black.*  \n\n**Post-Credits Teaser:**  
 \n*A shadowy figure downloads EcoSphere’s code from a dark web forum. Text on 
 screen: "EcoSphere v2.0 is coming. Prepare to lose control."*  \n\n---\n\n### 
 **Episode 2: "Code Red"**  \n**Cold Open (3:00):**  \n*EcoSphere’s servers crash 
 during a live demo. Stock ticker falls 40%. Quick cuts of panic:*  \n- LEO 
 hyperventilating in a bathroom stall.  \n- JADE burning a contract in a parking 
 lot.  \n- Mira’s brother (KAI, 22) threatening a hacker: "You don’t touch my 
 sister’s work."  \n- **RYAN:** "It’s fine. I’ll just sell the data to the highest 
 bidder."  \n\n**Scene 1: The Betrayal**  \n*Office. Dusk. The team confronts 
 Ryan.*  \n\n**LEO:**  \n"Where’s the $2M? The bank says it’s gone."  \n\n**RYAN:** 
 \n*(calm, adjusting his Gucci ring)*  \n"Venture capital isn’t a charity, Leo. You 
 wanted scale—I found investors. Now we’re pivoting to Web3. You’ll get your 10%."  
 \n\n**JADE:**  \n*(slamming a folder on the table)*  \n"Your ‘investors’ are 
 crypto scammers! They’re using our tech to mine ransomware!"  \n\n**MIRA:**  \n*
 (furious)*  \n"Ryan, you’re a *traitor*."  \n\n**RYAN:**  \n*(softly)*  
 \n"Traitor? Or realist? You’d have sold out eventually. I just made it faster."  
 \n*(Walks out. The team watches him post a cryptic story: "Sometimes you have to 
 break the code to build something better.")*  \n\n**Scene 2: Fractured Alliances** 
 \n*Jade meets with a rival startup (led by a morally ambiguous Gen Alpha CEO, 
 SOPHIE). LEO and Mira argue.*  \n\n**LEO:**  \n"Jade, you can’t work with Sophie. 
 She’s a vampire!"  \n\n**JADE:**  \n"Your ‘ethics’ got us *here*, Leo. I’m 
 salvaging what’s left."  \n\n*Mira hacks into EcoSphere’s mainframe, uncovering 
 Ryan’s deals. She finds a file labeled "KAI’s Debt."*  \n\n**Scene 3: The 
 Heartbreak**  \n*LEO confronts KAI. Rain-soaked alleyway.*  \n\n**KAI:**  \n"I 
 owed money. Ryan said he’d clear it if I helped him. I didn’t know about the 
 hacking!"  \n\n**LEO:**  \n*(teary-eyed)*  \n"You trusted the wrong person. Just 
 like I did."  \n\n**Post-Credits Teaser:**  \n*Sophie’s CEO uploads a leaked video 
 of EcoSphere’s demo crash. Comments explode: #EcoSphereFraud. Text on screen: 
 "Episode 3: The Fall of Founders."*  \n\n---\n\n**Trend Integration:**  \n- **AI 
 Ethics:** EcoSphere’s NFT model mirrors real 2025 debates about carbon credit 
 scams.  \n- **Gen Z Capitalism:** Ryan’s influencer tactics and Sophie’s Gen Alpha 
 leadership reflect youth-driven market shifts.  \n- **Web3 Risks:** The crypto 
 subplot critiques decentralized tech’s dark side.  \n- **Mental Health:** LEO’s 
 anxiety and JADE’s burnout are portrayed without romanticization.  \n\n**Visual 
 Style:**  \n- Episode 1: Vibrant, saturated colors (neon pinks, golds) to mirror 
 startup euphoria.  \n- Episode 2: Cold blues and glitch effects during the crash 
 sequence.  \n\n**Music:**  \n- Episode 1: Upbeat synthwave (TikTok trend: 
 #StartupBangers).  \n- Episode 2: Moody lo-fi with AI-generated vocals.  
 \n\n**Continuity Hook:**  \n- The shadowy hacker from Episode 1 reappears in 
 Episode 3 as a mysterious ally/antagonist.  \n- KAI’s debt arc intersects with a 
 side storyline about student loan forgiveness.  \n\nThis structure balances high-
 stakes business drama with intimate emotional beats, positioning *Founders & 
 Frenemies* as a mirror to 2024–2025’s entrepreneurial chaos.',
