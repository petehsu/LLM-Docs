[CompletionChoice(index=0, finish_reason='stop', message=CompletionMessage(content="
<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a market research report on the global new energy 
vehicle battery recycling industry for 2024–2025. Let me start by breaking down the 
user's requirements. They want coverage of market size, policies and regulations, 
technological development, competitive landscape, and future trends. Data must come 
from authoritative sources, and the format should be academic with a table of 
contents, charts, and references.\n\nFirst, I'll outline the structure. The user 
mentioned a table of contents, so I need to make sure each section is clearly 
defined. Let me think about the standard sections for a market report: Executive 
Summary, Market Overview, Market Size, Policies, Technology, Competitive Landscape, 
Future Trends, Conclusion, References, and Appendices. That should cover all the 
points.\n\nFor the market size, I need recent data. The user specified 2024–2025, 
so I should look for projections from credible sources like BloombergNEF, IEA, or 
McKinsey. Let me recall some numbers. BloombergNEF had a 2023 report mentioning 
2025 at $30 billion. That's a good starting point. Also, the IEA's 2023 report 
might have relevant data on EV sales and battery production, which ties into 
recycling needs.\n\nPolicies and regulations: The EU's Battery Regulation (2023), 
China's policies under the New Energy Vehicle Industry Roadmap 2025, and the U.S. 
Inflation Reduction Act. I need to check the effective dates and key points of 
each. The EU regulation aims for 70% recycling of batteries by 2030, which is 
crucial. China's roadmap emphasizes domestic recycling capacity, and the U.S. 
Inflation Reduction Act includes tax credits for recycling facilities. I should 
cite these official documents and recent analyses from IDTechEx or 
McKinsey.\n\nTechnological development: Key areas are pyrometallurgy, 
hydrometallurgy, and mechanical recycling. Companies like Redwood Materials, Li-
Cycle, and GEM are leading. Recent advancements in AI and IoT for sorting and 
monitoring. I need to mention specific technologies and sources like IDTechEx and 
company reports press releases.\n\nCompetitive landscape: Major players include 
automakers (Tesla, BYD), battery manufacturers (CATL, LG), and specialized 
recyclers (Redwood, Li-Cycle). Regional players like GEM in China and Umicore in 
Europe. Market share data from 2023, projecting to 2025. Sources like Grand View 
Research and Statista would be good.\n\nFuture trends: Growth drivers like EV 
adoption, circular economy policies, and cost reductions. Challenges like low 
tonnages and technical complexities. Opportunities in energy storage and raw 
material supply chain resilience. Cite BloombergNEF, McKinsey, and IDTechEx for 
these trends.\n\nReferences need to be authoritative. Academic journals, industry 
reports, government publications. Check if the sources are up-to-date, preferably 
from the last 2-3 years. Make sure to format them correctly in APA or another 
academic style.\n\nData charts: The user wants them included. I'll need to create a 
chart for market size growth, another for regional market share, and one for 
technological adoption. Since I can't generate actual images, I'll describe them 
and suggest they be included in the final report.\n\nPotential gaps: I should 
ensure that all data points are cited properly and that the report flows logically 
from overview to specific sections. Also, verify that the policies mentioned are 
the most recent and impactful. Maybe include a section on challenges and 
opportunities within the future trends part.\n\nWait, the user mentioned batch 
processing of tasks, but this is a single report. Maybe they meant if they had 
multiple reports, but in this case, focus on one. Also, check if the appendices are 
needed for supplementary data or charts.\n\nLet me start drafting each section with 
the outlined structure, ensuring each part is covered with the necessary data and 
citations. Make sure the language is rigorous and academic, avoiding jargon where 
possible but maintaining technical accuracy. Double-check that all sources are 
authoritative and recent. Once the draft is done, review for coherence and 
adherence to the user's specifications.\n</think>\n**Global New Energy Vehicle
