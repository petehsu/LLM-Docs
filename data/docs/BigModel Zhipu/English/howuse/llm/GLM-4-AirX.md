## GLM-4-AirX

GLM-4-AirX is the high-performance version of GLM-4-Air. It inherits the multilingual understanding and complex reasoning capabilities of the GLM-4 base model while featuring ultra-fast inference speed and powerful reasoning performance.

| **Price** | **Input Modality** | **Output Modality** | **Context Window** | **Maximum Output Tokens** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10 RMB per million tokens | Text | Text | 8K | 4K |

### **Recommended Use Cases**

1. **Intelligent Customer Service System:** Capable of handling massive volumes of user inquiries simultaneously, with millisecond-level response times to customer questions about product features, order status, after-sales policies, etc. It accurately understands multilingual inquiries and quickly accesses the enterprise’s business knowledge base to generate professional answers, effectively improving customer service efficiency and satisfaction.
2. **Real-Time Data Analysis:** When dealing with high-frequency real-time data streams such as financial trading data or industrial sensor data, it can perform low-latency inference and analysis under high concurrency, quickly identifying data anomalies, predicting trend changes, and generating actionable decision recommendations by integrating industry knowledge. (Recommended to combine with [search tools](https://www.bigmodel.cn/dev/howuse/websearch) for more real-time, accurate, and updated answers.)
3. **Mathematical Problem Reasoning:** In online math education platforms or research assistant scenarios, it can handle highly concurrent math problem-solving requests, performing millisecond-level analysis of complex math problems such as algebraic proofs, geometric modeling, and calculus derivations.

### **Detailed Description**

GLM-4-AirX is specifically designed for low-latency, high-concurrency scenarios. It was pre-trained on 15T of high-quality data, including a rich set of synthetic reasoning data that laid the foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning extensions. In the post-training phase, in addition to human preference alignment for dialogue scenarios, we used techniques such as rejection sampling and reinforcement learning to enhance the model’s performance in tasks like instruction following, engineering code generation, and function calling, thereby strengthening the fundamental capabilities required for agent tasks.

While maintaining the same performance as GLM-4-Air-250414, the model underwent technical iterations in its core components. Its inference process includes two stages—prefill and autoregressive decoder output—which give GLM-4-AirX faster inference speed and more powerful reasoning capabilities.

### **Features Supported**

Completion(model='glm-4-airx', created=1749454071,
choices=[CompletionChoice(index=0, finish_reason='stop',
message=CompletionMessage(content=("To calculate the covariance matrix of a two-
dimensional random variable, we need to consider two random variables, say X and Y, 
which form the two dimensions of our random vector. The covariance matrix, often 
denoted as Σ, is a square matrix that contains the variances and covariances of the 
random variables.\n\nLet's define the random vector as \\(\\mathbf{Z} = 
\\begin{bmatrix} X \\\\ Y \\end{bmatrix}\\). The covariance matrix Σ of the random 
vector \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nΣ = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\text{Cov}(X, X) 
& \\text{Cov}(X, Y) \\\\\n\\text{Cov}(Y, X) & \\text{Cov}(Y, 
Y)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe diagonal elements of this matrix are the variances of 
X and Y, respectively, and the off-diagonal elements are the covariance between X and 
Y. The covariance \\(\\text{Cov}(X, Y)\\) is calculated as follows:\n\n\\
[\n\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])]\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(E[\\cdot]\\) denotes 
the expected value operator.\n\nLet's assume we have the following:\n\n- \\(E[X] = 
\\mu_X\\)\n- \\(E[Y] = \\mu_Y\\)\n- \\(E[X^2] = \\sigma_X^2 + \\mu_X^2\\)\n- \\
(E[Y^2] = \\sigma_Y^2 + \\mu_Y^2\\)\n- \\(E[XY] = \\rho \\sigma_X \\sigma_Y + \\mu_X 
\\mu_Y\\)\n\nwhere \\(\\sigma_X^2\\) and \\(\\sigma_Y^2\\) are the variances of X and 
Y, respectively, and \\(\\rho\\) is the correlation coefficient between X and 
Y.\n\nThe covariance matrix can then be written as:\n\n\\[\nΣ = 
\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\sigma_X^2 & \\rho \\sigma_X \\sigma_Y \\\\\n\\rho \\sigma_X 
\\sigma_Y & \\sigma_Y^2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNow, to determine whether the 
covariance matrix is positive definite, we need to check if all the eigenvalues of 
the matrix are positive. However, for a 2x2 matrix, there is a simpler test based on 
the determinant and the leading principal minor (which is the top-left element of the 
matrix in this case).\n\nA 2x2 matrix \\(A = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d 
\\end{bmatrix}\\) is positive definite if and only if:\n\n1. The leading principal 
minor \\(a > 0\\)\n2. The determinant of A, \\(ad - bc > 0\\)\n\nApplying these 
conditions to our covariance matrix, we get:\n\n1. The leading principal minor (top-
left element, which is the variance of X) \\(\\sigma_X^2 > 0\\)\n2. The determinant 
of the covariance matrix, \\(\\sigma_X^2 \\cdot \\sigma_Y^2 - (\\rho \\sigma_X 
\\sigma_Y)^2 > 0\\)\n\nThe second condition simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_X^2 
\\sigma_Y^2 - \\rho^2 \\sigma_X^2 \\sigma_Y^2 > 0\n\\]\n\nwhich further simplifies 
to:\n\n\\[\n(1 - \\rho^2) \\sigma_X^2 \\sigma_Y^2 > 0\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\sigma_X^2 > 
0\\) and \\(\\sigma_Y^2 > 0\\) by definition (the variance of a random variable is 
always non-negative), the matrix is positive definite if and only if \\(1 - \\rho^2 > 
0\\), which is true as long as \\(\\rho^2 < 1\\). This means that the correlation 
coefficient must be less than 1 in absolute value (i.e., the random variables are not 
perfectly correlated in either direction).\n\nIn summary, the covariance matrix of a 
two-dimensional random variable is positive definite if the variances of the 
individual random variables are positive and the correlation coefficient is less than 
1 in absolute value."),
