### 【New Model Release】Two Popular Vidu Video Generation Models Now Available

📺 **[Vidu Q1](https://www.bigmodel.cn/dev/howuse/video-generation-model/ViduQ1)**  Focused on high-quality video creation, Vidu Q1 outputs fixed-length 5-second, 24-FPS, 1080P content. With enhanced clarity and refined visuals, its photorealistic style approaches real-world scenes, while maintaining fidelity in 2D animation aesthetics. Seamless frame transitions make it ideal for film, advertising, and animated shorts requiring top-tier production quality.

📺 **[Vidu 2](https://www.bigmodel.cn/dev/howuse/video-generation-model/Vidu2)**  Designed for balance between speed, quality, and cost, Vidu 2 specializes in image-to-video and keyframe-based generation, supporting 4-second 720P outputs. With improved visual stability and consistency across reference images and semantic keyframes, it is an efficient tool for mass production in e-commerce, entertainment, internet content, animation, and advertising.

### 【Model Release】

#### 🤖 [Speech Model](https://www.bigmodel.cn/dev/api/rtav/glm-asr)

* **GLM-ASR:** GLM-ASR transcribes audio into fluent and readable text based on contextual understanding, significantly improving the smoothness and readability of the output. Additionally, the model performs notably better in noisy environments compared to current models and is not interfered with by non-linguistic noise.

### 【Model Release】 Two Base Models and Three Inference Models Added at Once

#### 🤖 [Base Models](https://www.bigmodel.cn/dev/howuse/glm-4)

* **GLM-4-Air-250414 (Cost-Effective Version):** Excels in tasks such as engineering code, artifact generation, function calls, search-based Q&A, and report writing, with performance comparable to top-tier large-scale models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3-0324.
* **GLM-4-Flash-250414 (Free Version):** Free to use, still performs well in general tasks and is suitable for lightweight applications.

#### 🧠 [Inference Models](https://www.bigmodel.cn/dev/howuse/glm-z1)

* **GLM-Z1-AirX (Ultra-Fast Version):** The fastest inference model in China, reaching speeds of up to 200 tokens/second (8 times faster than standard models).
* **GLM-Z1-Air (Cost-Effective Version):** Priced at just 1/30 of DeepSeek-R1, ideal for high-frequency usage scenarios.
* **GLM-Z1-Flash (Free Version):** Free to use, further lowering the barrier to model adoption.

### 【Model Tools】All-in-One AI Search Tool Suite Updated and Upgraded

The full series of [AI Search Tools](https://www.bigmodel.cn/dev/howuse/websearch)  has been upgraded, covering three major services: basic retrieval (Web Search API), Q&A enhancement (Web Search in Chat), and search agents (Search Agent).
