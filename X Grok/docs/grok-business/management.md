#### Grok Business / Enterprise

# License & User Management

**The Grok Business overview page at [console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai) is your central hub for handling team licenses and user invitations.** As a team admin or user with appropriate permissions, you can buy licenses, invite new members, and manage access to ensure smooth collaboration.

Access this page by logging into [console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai) and navigating to the overview section. Note that actions like purchasing or provisioning require specific permissions—see the [Permissions](#permissions-and-troubleshooting) section for details.

## Purchasing Licenses

Expand your team's capabilities by buying additional licenses directly from the overview page.

Available license types:

* **SuperGrok:** Standard business access with enhanced quotas and features.
* **SuperGrok Heavy:** Upgraded performance for demanding workloads.

To purchase:

1. On the overview page, select the license type and quantity.
2. Enter payment details if prompted <em>(requires billing read-write permissions)</em>.
3. Confirm the purchase—licenses will be added to your available pool for assignment.

Purchased licenses become immediately available for provisioning to users.

&#x20;Ensure your team's billing is set up correctly to avoid
interruptions. Visit [Billing Settings](https://console.x.ai/team/default/billing) for more
details.

## Inviting Users

Invite new team members to join your Grok Business workspace with a simple email invitation process.

To invite:

1. On the overview page, click "Invite users to Grok Business".
2. Enter the users' email addresses.
3. Select a license type to auto-provision upon acceptance <em>(requires team read-write permissions)</em>.
4. Send the invitation—the user will receive an email with a link to activate their account.

Invited users gain access to the team workspace and basic team read permissions. (the latter is to allow for sharing conversations with your team members)

View invited users in the "Pending invitations" list on the overview page. As long as you have unassigned licenses available, they will be automatically provisioned when the user accepts.

## Assigning and Revoking Licenses

Once licenses are purchased or available, assign them to users for full team workspace access.

To assign:

1. From the overview page, select a user from your team list.
2. Choose an available license and assign it—access activates immediately.

To revoke:

1. Click the "..." for the user and choose "Unassign License" from the dropdown.
2. Confirm the action—the license returns to your available pool, and the user's will no longer have access to your team's workspace.

Revocations take effect instantly, but ensure you communicate changes to affected users.

&#x20;Revoking a license removes team workspace access. Users will
retain personal workspace functionality.

## Canceling Licenses

Reduce your team's commitment by canceling unused licenses.

To cancel:

1. On the overview page, select the license type and quantity to cancel.
2. Submit the cancellation request <em>(requires billing read-write permissions)</em>.

Cancellations may take a few days to process, and eligible refunds will be issued to your billing method. Canceled licenses are removed from your pool once processed.

## Permissions and Troubleshooting

Most management actions require specific role-based permissions:

* **Billing Read-Write:** Needed to purchase or cancel licenses.
* **Team Read-Write:** Needed to invite users or assign/revoke licenses.

These are typically granted only to team admins. If you lack permissions:

* Contact your team admin to request actions like license assignment or purchases.
* Admins can adjust permissions via the overview page's role settings.

If you encounter issues, such as invitations not provisioning due to insufficient licenses, purchase more or revoke unused ones first.
