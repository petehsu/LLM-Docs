#### Grok Business / Enterprise

# Grok.com User Guide

**Grok Business provides dedicated workspaces for personal and team use, with enhanced privacy and sharing controls.** Switch between workspaces to access team-specific features and ensure your conversations are protected under business plan terms.

A team workspace offers:

* Privacy guarantees as outlined in xAI's [terms of service](https://x.ai/legal/terms-of-service-enterprise).
* Full benefits of SuperGrok (or SuperGrok Heavy for upgraded licenses).
* Secure sharing of conversations limited to active team members.

## Workspaces Overview

Grok Business features two types of workspaces:

* **Personal Workspace:** For individual use, available unless disabled by your organization.
* **Team Workspace:** For collaborative work within your team, accessible only with an active license.

To switch between workspaces, use the workspace selector in the bottom left navigation on grok.com. Ensure you are in the correct workspace before starting new conversations.

&#x20;You can only access the team workspace when you have an
active license. If you lack access, contact your team admin.

## Privacy and Benefits

In your team workspace, enjoy enterprise-grade privacy protections as detailed in xAI's [terms of service](https://x.ai/legal/terms-of-service-enterprise). This includes data handling and, for the Enterprise tier, custom retention policies tailored for business use.

Additionally, unlock the full capabilities of SuperGrok, including higher usage quotas and advanced features. If your organization has an upgraded license, you may access SuperGrok Heavy for even more powerful performance.

Some users may not see a personal workspace. This indicates your organization has disabled
personal workspaces via an enterprise license. To enable or disable personal workspaces, reach out
to xAI sales for an Enterprise plan.

## Sharing Conversations

Sharing is restricted to your team for security:

* Share conversations only with team members who have active licenses.
* Share links are only accessible to licensed team members.
* If sent to non-team members or unlicensed team members, the link will not open.

To share a conversation:

1. Open the conversation in your team workspace.
2. Click the share button and select team members.
3. Generate and distribute the secure link.

View all shared conversations in your history at [https://grok.com/history?tab=shared-with-me](https://grok.com/history?tab=shared-with-me).

## Activating Your License

To activate or manage your license:

1. Visit your Grok Business overview at [console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai).
2. Press "Assign license" and select your license type.
3. If you encounter access issues or lack permissions, contact your team admin for assistance.
