## Deduction Rules​

The expense = number of tokens × price. The corresponding fees will be directly deducted from your topped-up balance or granted balance, with a preference for using the granted balance first when both balances are available.

Product prices may vary and DeepSeek reserves the right to adjust them. We recommend topping up based on your actual usage and regularly checking this page for the most recent pricing information.
