## GLM-4V-Plus-0111

GLM-4V-Plus-0111 is Zhipu’s next-generation visual-language model. It features visual summarization, visual editing, reasoning, multi-turn dialogue, and temporal question-answering capabilities. It supports a wide range of image and video understanding tasks, including visual question answering, image captioning, visual grounding, and complex object detection.

| **Price** | **Input Modality** | **Output Modality** | **Context Window** | **Maximum Output Tokens** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 RMB per million tokens | Video/Image/Text | Text | 16K | Dynamic Computation: Context-Input |

### **Recommended Use Cases**

1. **Advertising Creative Evaluation:** Supports parsing the visual elements of advertising videos (such as brand logo exposure time and scene composition rationality), automatically classifying content styles and labeling emotional tendencies. Combined with video event analysis capabilities, it assesses target audience match and provides data-driven optimization suggestions for advertising planning.
2. **Educational Courseware Production:** Analyzes teaching images and video content, automatically summarizes key knowledge points, answers students’ questions through visual question answering, and helps teachers quickly generate high-quality, visually enriched courseware.
3. **Industrial Quality Inspection:** Performs complex object detection on product images on the production line, quickly locates defect positions, generates quality inspection reports through visual summarization, and achieves efficient, automated quality control.
4. **Social Platform Content Review:** Real-time capture of video streams and image libraries, precise classification of non-compliant content on media platforms, and automatic segmentation of problematic segments. By tagging videos and analyzing events, it generates structured review reports, assisting platforms in efficiently completing compliance screening.

### **Detailed Description**

1. **More Accurate Visual Description Capabilities** GLM-4V-Plus-0111 achieves deep integration of visual and language features without sacrificing performance on any NLP task. Thanks to the advantages of native resolution input and continuous hallucination optimization powered by the data flywheel, it offers lower hallucination rates and more comprehensive visual content description capabilities. In addition to detailed descriptions, GLM-4V-Plus-0111**​ ​**can also classify image and video data, generate titles, and assign tags. Users can enhance image and video processing efficiency or build automated visual data workflows using customized prompts.
2. **Precise Temporal Awareness** Unlike images, video data contains an additional time dimension. Most other visual understanding models lack temporal awareness and temporal question answering capabilities because they do not take timestamp information as input. GLM-4V-Plus-0111’s temporal question answering ability helps quickly locate the time points of specific events, enabling semantic segmentation and automated video editing.
3. **Fine-Grained Action Understanding** When image resolution or video frame rate is too low, even humans struggle to perceive subtle movements in videos. GLM-4V-Plus-0111 offers more fine-grained action understanding and precise analysis of visual details.
4. **Concurrent Multi-Image Support and Ultra-Long Video Understanding** GLM-4V-Plus-0111 has outstanding multimodal understanding capabilities and can process up to 5 images concurrently. With variable resolution technology, it can accommodate a wider range of video lengths and resolutions, supporting video understanding of up to 2 hours—breaking the ceiling for video processing and expanding the business scenarios of visual understanding models.

In the background, rolling mountains covered in green vegetation rise up, their peaks shrouded in mist, adding a sense of mystery. In the distance, there is a small pavilion on the rocks by the lake, harmoniously blending with the natural surroundings.

The first image is a landscape painting depicting natural scenery such as cherry blossom trees, lakes, and mountains, featuring rich colors and a springtime atmosphere. The second image, on the other hand, is a photograph of the Great Wall in winter, with the wall winding through snow-covered mountains. The overall color tone is cool, giving a sense of coldness and tranquility.

In terms of composition, the first image uses a symmetrical layout centered on the cherry blossom tree, with the surrounding scenery balanced on both sides to create a harmonious visual effect. The second image uses a diagonal composition, with the Great Wall as a leading line that guides the viewer’s gaze through the entire image, adding depth and a dynamic feel.

Overall, these two images show clear differences in content, color, composition, and atmosphere: the first is a lively and colorful spring landscape, while the second is a quiet and mysterious winter view of the Great Wall.
