## GLM-ASR

GLM-ASR is Zhipu’s next-generation speech recognition model. Compared with traditional ASR models, GLM-ASR has achieved significant improvements in contextual understanding, noise resistance, and multilingual transcription, making it widely applicable to various speech-to-text scenarios.

| **Price** | **Input Modality** | **Output Modality** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.06 RMB per minute | Audio | Text |

### **Recommended Use Cases**

* **Customer Service:** Real-time recording of customer voice requests, enabling easy post-call review and improving service responsiveness and quality.
* **Human-Computer Interaction:** Control smart devices (such as home appliances and robots) via voice commands for a seamless, hands-free interaction experience.
* **Meeting Transcription:** Generates accurate meeting and classroom notes, supporting mixed Chinese and English input and recognizing specialized terms, to aid in efficient review and knowledge retention.
* **Subtitle Generation:** Instantly generates high-accuracy subtitles for audio and video, meeting the needs of scenarios like live conference broadcasts, film editing, and online courses.
* **Gaming Voice:** Accurately recognizes high-frequency gaming terminology and slang, enabling seamless transcription of voice commands and tactical communication during gameplay.
* **Content Quality Inspection:** Intelligently transcribes recordings into text, uses rule-based systems to detect and flag prohibited content in real-time, and simultaneously analyzes voice data to uncover potential business value.
* **Voice Search:** Quickly responds to dialects or accented commands in in-car navigation and mobile scenarios, freeing users’ hands and improving search efficiency.

### **Detailed Description**

As a speech-to-text model based on deep contextual understanding, GLM-ASR not only transcribes audio into fluent, natural text that aligns with language conventions, but also demonstrates exceptional noise resistance in complex acoustic environments, offering you a new level of surprise in speech-to-text:

1. **Contextual Intelligent Understanding:** Powered by advanced language modeling technology, the model can optimize output results by incorporating contextual information, significantly improving the fluency and readability of transcribed text and making it closer to natural expression.
2. **Strong Noise Resistance:** Even in the presence of non-speech noise (such as mechanical sounds or ambient noise), the model maintains high-precision recognition, avoiding misrecognition and omissions, and adapts to multi-scenario needs.
3. **Multi-Language and Multi-Dialect Support:** Supports Chinese, English, and eight Chinese regional dialects (Northeastern Mandarin, Jiaoliao Mandarin, Beijing Mandarin, Jilu Mandarin, Central Plains Mandarin, Jianghuai Mandarin, Lanyin Mandarin, and Southwestern Mandarin), breaking regional communication barriers and meeting diverse voice interaction needs.

### **Example**
