## 3. Recharge Conditions

3.1 When you recharge, you should have a Large Model Open Platform account that has been successfully verified through real-name authentication.

## 4. Account Security

4.1 When users recharge, they should carefully confirm their account and information. If the user’s rights are damaged due to improper operation, lack of understanding, or insufficient understanding of the recharge billing method, etc., the user should bear the responsibility themselves.

4.2 When users use the services provided by third-party payment enterprises during recharge, they should comply with the agreements and service rules of that third party; during the use of third-party payment services, users should properly safeguard their personal information, including but not limited to bank account numbers, passwords, verification codes, etc.; users agree and confirm that Zhipu Technology does not bear any responsibility for disputes arising from third-party payment services.

## 5. Recharge Methods

5.1 Users can choose third-party payment enterprises recognized by Zhipu Technology (currently supporting Alipay and WeChat) to pay the recharge amount.

5.2 If a user entrusts a third party to recharge their consumption account, the user promises and guarantees that they understand and trust the third party, and the third party also understands and agrees to accept the user’s commission to recharge for them; otherwise, if Zhipu Technology is informed by the third party that such recharge is not agreed upon by the third party, Zhipu Technology has the right to immediately lock the user’s consumption account (during the account lock period, Zhipu Technology will suspend the user’s use of services and also lock the user’s API keys, the same below). Within 30 days from the date the user’s consumption account is locked, the user should provide sufficient evidence to confirm that the third party agreed to recharge for them in advance, otherwise, the user agrees and authorizes Zhipu Technology to cooperate with the third party’s requirements to refund the corresponding amount from the user’s locked consumption account to the third party. If the balance of the user’s consumption account is insufficient at that time, the user agrees to recharge the corresponding amount within 30 days at the latest, entrusting Zhipu Technology to refund, or to refund from their WeChat account or Alipay account themselves, unless the third party agrees that the user does not need to refund this part of the amount.

5.3 The user promises and guarantees that the funds used for the recharge of their consumption account are of legal origin, otherwise, Zhipu Technology has the right to cooperate with the requirements of judicial authorities or other government authorities to deal with the user’s consumption account accordingly, including but not limited to locking the user’s consumption account, etc.
