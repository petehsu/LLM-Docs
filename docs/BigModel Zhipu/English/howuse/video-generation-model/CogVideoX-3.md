# **CogVideoX-3**

CogVideoX-3 features new frame generation capabilities that significantly improve image stability and clarity. It also delivers superior performance in handling subjects with significant movement, better adheres to instructions, and provides more realistic simulations. Additionally, it enhances the rendering of high-definition real-world and 3D-style scenes.

| Duration | Resolution | Price | Input Modality | Output Modality |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5s, 10s | Supports multiple resolutions, up to 4K | 1 RMB per use | Image, Text, Start and End Frame | Video |

**Recommended Scenarios**

* **Advertising and Marketing**: Input product images or copy to quickly generate dynamic ads in multiple styles, supporting scene transitions and realistic lighting rendering.
* **Short Video Creation**: Convert single-frame images or text scripts into smooth, naturally animated short videos, covering both realistic and 3D styles.
* **Tourism Promotion**: Upload scenic spot photos and promotional text to generate immersive tourism short videos with realistic natural landscapes.
* **Film and TV Production**: Input storyboards or character design images to automatically generate dynamic preview clips, simulating seamless camera movements and realistic physical interactions.

### **Resources**

### **Detailed Introduction**

1. #### **Significantly Improved Subject Clarity**

Videos generated by CogVideoX-3 feature clear subjects, stable frames, reduced distortion issues, and support for subjects to move extensively, resulting in more natural and fluid dynamic performance.

| Prompt | Video |
| --- | --- |
| The petals were blown by the wind, spinning  continuously and transforming into a person. |  |
| Nezha happily took a sip of wine, then showed off  the brand of wine. Description |  |

2. #### **Better Command Compliance and Realistic Physical Simulation**

Deeply understands the intent of text commands and accurately reproduces creative requirements. Whether it is having a character perform specific actions or simulating natural physical phenomena, it can be presented in accordance with real-world logic.

| Prompt | Video |
| --- | --- |
| A pair of hands holding a fruit knife,  slicing a whole red tomato into slices. |  |
| In an open-plan office, an employee is  looking down at his phone. Suddenly,  the manager appears and taps him on  the shoulder. Startled, he quickly puts  his phone away. |  |

3. #### **Enhanced High-Definition Realistic-Style Scenes and 3D-Style Scene Rendering**

For realistic styles, it can create high-definition textures akin to real-life photography; when switching to 3D styles, it can precisely shape three-dimensional forms and scene atmospheres, effortlessly handling multiple styles.

| Prompt | Video |
| --- | --- |
| A high-angle shot captures Dou E and  the sky. Dou E was an innocent woman  from ancient China who was wrongfully  accused. At this moment, she is looking  up and shouting. Under the scorching  June sun, white snow falls from the sky,  scattering upon contact with bloodstains.  Her clothes flutter slightly, accompanied  by a 3D particle wind. |  |
| A stylish anthropomorphic snow leopard  wearing a white leopard-print fashion coat,  super fluffy, plush, thick, and luxurious,  walking the runway in ultra-high definition  with a cinematic feel, reminiscent of a  blockbuster movie, like a Victoria’s Secret  fashion show. The runway is lined with  spectators taking photos on both sides. |  |

4. #### **Added Start and End Frame Generation**

Supports users providing start and end frames, automatically generating seamless transition content, allowing static frames to naturally connect into dynamic narratives, and linking complete creative concepts.

| Prompt | Start and End Frame | Video |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The Dragon King transforms into Ao Bing,  with ink wash-style shading. The main  character slowly transforms, highlighting  the details of the transformation. The  camera rotates smoothly, creating a  natural and fluid transition. | DescriptionDescription |  |
| The character holds a gun in both hands  and shoots wildly at the computer screen.  The computer catches fire, explodes, and  shatters into pieces, sending debris flying  everywhere. The office lights flicker. | Description Description |  |

### **Example**

#### **Text-to-Video Generation**

```
from zhipuai import ZhipuAI
client = ZhipuAI(api_key="") # Please enter your own APIKey.

response = client.videos.generations(
    model="cogvideox-3",
    prompt="Peter Rabbit drives a small car, cruising along the road with a look of joy and delight on his face.",
    quality=“quality”,  # Output mode, ‘quality’ prioritizes quality, “speed” prioritizes speed
    with_audio=True,
    size="1920x1080",  # Video resolution, supports up to 4K (e.g., “3840x2160”)
    fps=30,  # Frame rate, optional values are 30 or 60
)
print(response)

### **User Concurrency Rights**

API calls are subject to rate limits. Currently, we limit the number of concurrent requests (the number of in-flight request tasks). The concurrency guarantees for different user tiers are as follows.

| V0 | V1 | V2 | V3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 |
