## **Vidu 2**

Vidu 2 is a next-generation video generation model that strikes a balance between speed and quality. It focuses on image-to-video generation and keyframe-based video creation, supporting 720P resolution for videos up to 4 seconds long. With significantly faster generation speed and reduced cost, it addresses color distortion issues in image-to-video outputs, delivering stable and controllable visuals ideal for e-commerce scenarios. Enhanced semantic understanding between keyframes and improved consistency with multiple reference images make Vidu 2 a highly efficient tool for mass production in pan-entertainment, internet content, anime short series, and advertising.

| **Model Version** | **Capabilities** | **Duration** | **Resolution** | **Price** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vidu2-image | Image-to-Video Generation | 4s | 720p | 1.25RMB per use |
| vidu2-start-end | Start and End Frame | 4s | 720p | 1.25RMB per use |
| vidu2-reference | Reference-based Video Generation | 4s | 720p | 2.5RMB per use |

### **Capability Description**

* ​**Image-to-Video Generation**​: Generate a video by providing a starting frame or both starting and ending frames along with corresponding text descriptions.
* ​**Start and End Frame**​: Supports input of two images: the first uploaded image is treated as the starting frame, and the second as the ending frame. The model uses these images as input parameters to generate the video.
* ​**Reference-based Video Generation**​: Generate a video from a text prompt; currently supports both a general style and an anime style optimized for animation.

Note: The URL link for the video generated by the model is valid for one day. Please save it as soon as possible if needed.

### **Recommended Use Cases**

| Scenario Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **General Entertainment Content Generation** | - Input a single frame or IP elements to quickly generate short videos with coherent storylines and interactive special effects - Supports diverse visual styles from anime-inspired to realistic - Tailored for mass production of UGC creative content on short video platforms |
| **​ Anime Short Drama Production** | - Input static character images or keyframes to generate smooth animated sequences and micro-dramas - Accurately reproduce detailed character movements (e.g., facial expressions) - Supports mass production in various styles such as Chinese and Japanese anime - Designed to meet animation studios’ needs for IP-based content expansion |
| **Advertising & E-commerce Marketing** | - Input real product images to intelligently generate dynamic advertising videos - Clearly showcase product features such as 3C details and beauty product textures - Automatically adapt to various platform formats, such as vertical videos for Tiktok and horizontal layouts for social feeds |

### **Detailed Description**

1. **Efficient Video Generation Speed**

With optimized model computing architecture, video rendering efficiency is significantly enhanced. This allows daily content teams to respond quickly to trending topics, and enables e-commerce sellers to mass-produce product display videos on demand—greatly reducing content delivery time and helping creators seize traffic windows.

2. **Cost-effective 720P Output**

The cost of generating 720P resolution videos has dropped to 40% of the Q1 version. Small and medium-sized brands can now create batch videos for multiple SKUs, while advertising teams can test creative concepts like “product close-ups + scenario storytelling” at a lower cost—meeting full-platform marketing needs without breaking the content budget.

3. **Stable and Controllable Image-to-Video Generation**

The model addresses the “texture color shift” issue—accurately restoring details like the silky glow of satin or the matte finish of leather in clothing videos. In e-commerce scenarios, product colors are displayed more realistically. Dynamic frame compensation is optimized, ensuring smooth, shake-free motion for rotating 3C products or hand demonstrations in beauty tutorials. Multiple visual styles are supported, enabling eye-catching content like “product close-up + stylized camera movement,” ideal for e-commerce main images and short-form promotional videos.

4. **Semantically Enhanced Keyframe Transition**

The model strikes a balance between creativity and stability, delivering significantly improved performance and semantic understanding—making it the optimal solution for keyframe-based video generation. By accurately analyzing scene logic and action continuity, transitions between frames are smooth and natural, enhancing narrative coherence throughout the content.
