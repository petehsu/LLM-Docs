​**​Latest Version Effective Date: May 30, 2025​**​

Welcome to the Large Model Open Platform. By entering into this **User Agreement** (hereinafter referred to as the “Agreement”) with the Large Model Open Platform, you agree to use the services provided by the Large Model Open Platform (as defined below).

### **Important Notices**

**[Careful Reading]** Before clicking “Agree” during the registration process, you must carefully read this Agreement. Please ensure you fully understand all terms, especially those regarding liability limitations, applicable laws, and dispute resolution, with particular attention to the **bold and underlined sections**. If you have any questions, you may consult the Large Model Open Platform customer service. In addition to this Agreement, you must also comply with all user agreements, usage guidelines, security review policies, API documentation, notices, and other requirements on the Open Platform (see links such as <https://open.bigmodel.cn/dev/howuse/ProtocolStatement>，<https://open.bigmodel.cn/dev/howuse/securityaudit>）.

**[Agreement Action]** By completing the registration process—providing required information, reading, and agreeing to this Agreement—you confirm that you have fully read, understood, and accepted all terms herein, thereby becoming a user of the Large Model Open Platform (hereinafter referred to as “User” or “You”). If you disagree with any part of this Agreement during the registration process, you must immediately discontinue registration. If you have separately entered into other legal agreements with **Zhipu** regarding the use of its services, conflicting terms in such agreements shall prevail over this Agreement.

### **1. Definitions**

* **Zhipu**: Refers to **Beijing Zhipu Huazhang Technology Co., Ltd.**
* **Large Model Open Platform**: Refers to the platform operated by Zhipu that provides natural language processing, open platform services, API calls, and other services, including any new service types developed by Zhipu from time to time.
* **Large Model Open Platform Service Provider**: Refers to Zhipu, the provider of internet information and software technical services for the Large Model Open Platform.
* **Large Model Open Platform Rules**: All existing and future rules, interpretations, announcements, and other content published by the Large Model Open Platform.
* **Affiliated Companies**: Refers to companies affiliated with Zhipu. For any entity (including individuals, companies, partnerships, organizations, or any other entities), this includes entities directly or indirectly controlled by it, entities controlling it, or entities under the same control. “Control” means the power to direct management or decision-making, whether through voting rights, contracts, or other means, directly or indirectly.

### **2. Account Registration and Use**

To use the Large Model Open Platform services, you must first complete user registration or real-name verification.

#### **2.1 User Eligibility**

You confirm that, before registering, you possess the civil capacity required under the laws of the People’s Republic of China to engage in the corresponding activities. If you lack such capacity, you must register under the supervision and consent of a legal guardian. Violations of laws, regulations, or this Agreement may result in legal liability for you and your guardian.

You may use the Large Model Open Platform without logging in or registering, but core services or features will be unavailable.

#### **2.2 Account Registration**

Account registration refers to the process where a user registers an account on the Large Model Open Platform using a mobile phone number they are authorized to use, provides required information, and agrees to this Agreement. If evidence or platform rules indicate improper registration or misuse of multiple accounts, the Large Model Open Platform may freeze or close accounts, deny services, or take other measures. You shall be liable for any losses caused to the platform or related parties.

Users are categorized as **individual users** or **enterprise users**. Please register under the appropriate category based on your identity and actual usage.

* If you represent an enterprise or entity and voluntarily accept this Agreement or use our services:
  1. “You” refers to both you personally and the represented enterprise/entity.
  2. You confirm and warrant that you are a legally authorized representative with the authority to bind the entity to these terms.
  3. The represented entity assumes all legal and financial responsibilities for your actions, including those of its employees, agents, or contractors accessing or using your account. Your acceptance of this Agreement or use of our services constitutes the entity’s agreement.
* If you represent yourself as an individual, “You” refers solely to you, and you assume full responsibility for your use of the services.

#### **2.3 Account Security**

You may log in using your registered mobile number, username, email, and password. Your account is self-managed, and the Large Model Open Platform will never proactively request your password. You are responsible for safeguarding your account. The platform is not liable for losses due to unauthorized disclosure, hacking, or fraud. You must pursue legal or administrative remedies against perpetrators.

Your account is linked to your personal information and is for your use only. Unauthorized third-party access or data sharing is prohibited. If the platform determines your account usage poses security risks, it may deny services or terminate this Agreement.

#### **2.4 Updates and Maintenance**

You must promptly update your information. Where laws require the platform to verify user information, you must cooperate by providing accurate, complete, and valid details.

If the platform cannot contact you using your last-provided information, if you fail to provide requested updates, or if your information is found false by authorities, you bear all resulting losses. The platform may suspend or terminate services without liability and require re-authentication.
