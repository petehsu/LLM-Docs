# Large Model Open Platform Account Deletion Agreement

**Effective Date of Latest Version: May 6, 2025**

Dear User,  
Hello!  
Before you apply to delete your Large Model Open Platform account (hereinafter referred to as the “Account”), please carefully read and agree to all the terms below, especially the highlighted content. By clicking “Confirm Deletion” or proceeding further, you are deemed to have agreed to this agreement.

**1. Account Status**  
Ensure that your Account is in good standing, with no unresolved disputes, conflicts, or violations (e.g., unpaid fees, incomplete transactions, complaints, etc.). If any such issues exist, please resolve them before submitting a deletion request. Before applying for deletion, properly handle all Account-related business, including but not limited to downloading or backing up important data, and disassociating from other services or third-party applications.

**2. Identity Verification**  
To confirm that the deletion request is initiated by you as the Account owner, please provide the SMS verification code registered with your Account or complete verification via the bound email address. We will review your application, including checks on Account status and identity authenticity. If the review fails, we will clearly notify you of the reason (e.g., unresolved issues). If approved, your Account will be deleted within 7 business days.

**3. Data Deletion**  
After deletion, your personal information, content, and data within the Account will be deleted or anonymized. If immediate deletion is technically infeasible (e.g., backup system data cleanup requires additional time), we will immediately cease all processing except for storage and necessary security measures. If your Account contains personal information subject to statutory retention periods (e.g., transaction records), such data will be deleted or anonymized immediately upon expiration of the retention period.

---

**4. Account Termination and Rights Handling**  
After deletion, your Account will be permanently closed, and you will no longer be able to log in or use related services (e.g., membership benefits, subscriptions). For products or services purchased prior to deletion:  
• Refundable benefits (e.g., cash balance): You may submit a refund request to customer service before deletion.

• Non-refundable benefits (e.g., resource packs, coupons, points, or other virtual benefits issued by the platform): If you proceed with deletion, these benefits will be deemed voluntarily forfeited.

**5. Legal Liability**  
After deletion, you remain responsible for actions taken prior to deletion (e.g., posting infringing content).

**6. Other**  
Matters not covered in this agreement shall be governed by the [User Agreement](https://bigmodel.cn/dev/howuse/useragreement) .

Thank you for using our services!  
If you have questions about the deletion process, please contact our customer service team for assistance.
