# FAQ - Grok Website / Apps

While the documentation is mainly meant for our API users, you can find some commonly asked questions here for our consumer-facing website/apps.

## How can I link my X account sign-in/subscription to my xAI account?

On [Grok Website](https://grok.com), go to Settings -> Account. Click on Connect your X Account button. This will take you to X's SSO page to add X account as a sign-in method for xAI.

xAI will be able to retrieve your X subscription status and grant relevant benefits after linking.

You can manage your sign-in methods at https://accounts.x.ai.

## How can I delete the account?

Your xAI account can be deleted by following the steps here: [How do I delete my account?](../faq-grok#how-can-i-delete-the-account) If you are using the same account to access our API, your API access will be removed as well.

## How do I unsubscribe?

If you have subscribed to SuperGrok, you can go to https://grok.com -> Settings -> Billing to manage your subscription (purchased from Grok Website), [Request a refund for app](https://support.apple.com/118223) (purchased from Apple App Store), or [Cancel, pause or change a subscription on Google Play](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481) (purchased from Google Play).

If you have subscribed to X Premium, X (not xAI) would be responsible for processing refund where required by law. You can [submit a refund request from X](https://help.x.com/forms/x-refund-request). See more details regarding X Premium subscriptions on [X Help Center](https://help.x.com/using-x/x-premium).
