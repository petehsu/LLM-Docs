This solution aims to help partner platforms **exponentially reduce audiobook production costs and significantly increase audio content coverage**. It provides users with an **immersive listening experience comparable to live human narration**, thereby building a strong content moat.

## Pain Points

We deeply understand the core challenges that novel platforms face in the audio content domain.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="High Production Costs and Long Cycles" icon="trending-up-down">
    Traditional audiobook production requires hiring professional voice actors, recording studios, and post-production teams, leading to high costs (tens to hundreds of thousands of yuan) and long production cycles (weeks or even months) for a single book.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Flat, Monotonous Emotional Expression" icon="speech">
    Audio generated by traditional TTS (Text-to-Speech) technology lacks emotion and has a mechanical tone, failing to express the joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness of characters in a novel, resulting in a poor listening experience.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Lack of Context, Incoherent Narration" icon="droplet-off">
    In long novels, standard TTS struggles to understand contextual connections, leading to disjointed character emotions and tones between chapters, which severely affects the story's coherence and immersiveness.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Slow Content Updates, Low Coverage" icon="arrow-down-wide-narrow">
    Faced with a massive number of chapters updated daily on the platform, the speed of manual production is far from adequate. This results in the vast majority of works not having an audio version, thus missing out on a large audience of "listeners".
  </Card>

  <Card title="Monotonous Voices, Difficult to Distinguish Characters" icon="ear-off">
    Platforms find it difficult to provide a sufficiently rich and personalized voice library to meet the stylistic needs of different novel genres (e.g., fantasy, romance, suspense). Distinguishing between multiple characters in a dialogue becomes particularly challenging.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Core Objectives

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Ensure High Consistency of Emotion and Context" icon="waves">
    Achieve a deep understanding of long texts exceeding 10,000 characters to ensure that narration and character emotions remain coherent and natural throughout the entire chapter, aligning with the plot's development.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Achieve Rich and Customizable Multi-Character Narration" icon="tent">
    Provide a large and continuously expanding "virtual voice actor" library that supports AI in automatically matching unique voices to different characters, while also allowing platforms for personalized customization.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Maximize the Production Efficiency of Audio Content" icon="git-compare">
    Compress the traditional weeks-long production cycle into minutes. Support single inputs of up to 35,000 characters, enabling "second-level" generation of entire novel chapters and making it possible to convert the entire site's novel library into audio.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Solution

### Step 1: Intelligent Full-Chapter Text Injection

Submit the novel chapter text to be converted (supports up to one million characters) in a single API call. The system will automatically perform text preprocessing, such as identifying chapter titles, narration, and dialogue.

### Step 2: AI Director Intelligent Analysis

Our large model will act as an "AI Director":

* **Contextual Understanding:** Accurately parse the article's intent, understanding character relationships and plot progression.
* **Character Recognition:** Automatically identify different characters in the dialogue and match them with the most suitable voice from the voice library.
* **Emotion Analysis:** Precisely identify the emotional tone of each sentence (e.g., excited, sad, tense, gentle) to provide "performance direction" for the subsequent speech synthesis.

### Step 3: Dynamic Speech Synthesis and Delivery

Based on the analysis results, the AI performs the final speech synthesis:

* **Multi-Voice Fusion:** Dynamically switch between different character voices, with steady narration and lively character portrayals.
* **Emotional Prosody:** The generated speech is rich in variations of speed, pause, stress, and intonation, perfectly matching the text's emotion.
* **Fast Delivery:** Upon task completion, the API returns a URL for a high-quality MP3 audio file, ready for direct playback or distribution.

## Business Value

## Core API Capabilities

This solution primarily relies on the following three API endpoints:

### 1. Create Audiobook Generation Task

[POST https://api.minimax.io/v1/t2a\_async\_v2](/api-reference/speech-t2a-async-create)

* **Purpose:** Create an asynchronous audiobook generation task. This is the core API call.
* **Key Parameters:**
  * `text` The text content of the novel.
  * `voice_setting` Settings for speech synthesis, such as specifying multi-character mode, enabling/disabling emotion analysis, etc.
  * `audio_setting` Optional configuration to specify the preferred format for the generated audio.

### 2. Query Task Status

[POST http://api.minimax.io/v1/query/t2a\_async\_query\_v2](/api-reference/speech-t2a-async-query)

* **Purpose:** Query the current status of a specified task (e.g., queued, processing, completed, failed).
* **Key Parameters:**

## Usage Example

The following is a Python code example for creating an audiobook generation task.

<CodeGroup dropdown>
  ```python  theme={null}
  import requests
  import json

  # ========== Configuration ==========
  group_id = "{Groupid}"
  api_key = "{API KEY}"
  file_path = "your file path"

  # ========== Step 1: Upload File ==========
  upload_url = f"https://api.minimax.io/v1/files/upload?GroupId={group_id}"

  payload = {'purpose': 't2a_async_input'}
  files = [
      ('file', (file_path.split("/")[-1], open(file_path, 'rb'), 'application/zip'))
  ]
  headers = {
      'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
  }

  response = requests.post(upload_url, headers=headers, data=payload, files=files)
  print("Upload Response:", response.text)

  # Parse file_id
  try:
      file_id = response.json().get("file", {}).get("id")
  except Exception:
      file_id = None

  if not file_id:
      raise ValueError("❌ File upload failed, could not get file_id")

  # ========== Step 2: Call T2A Async API ==========
  t2a_url = f"https://api.minimax.io/v1/t2a_async_v2?GroupId={group_id}"

  payload = json.dumps({
    "model": "speech-2.6-hd",
    "text_file_id": file_id,   # Use the file_id obtained from the upload
    "language_boost": "auto",
    "voice_setting": {
      "voice_id": "audiobook_male_1",
      "speed": 1,
      "vol": 10,
      "pitch": 1
    },
    "audio_setting": {
