# Introduction

The Zhìpǔ AI Open Platform offers a variety of large models with different functionalities and pricing, including general-purpose large models, super-humanoid large models, image large models, and vector large models. It also supports fine-tuning these models using your private data.

On January 16, 2024, we launched the new generation of foundational large model, GLM-4, at the ‘Zhìpǔ AI Technology Open Day (ZHIPU DevDay)’.

## Key Concepts

#### GLM

GLM, short for General Language Model, is a pre-trained language model based on autoregressive filling. The ChatGLM series models support relatively complex natural language instructions and are capable of solving difficult reasoning problems. Equipped with an easy-to-use API interface, this model allows developers to seamlessly integrate it into various applications. It is widely used in fields such as intelligent customer service, virtual anchors, chatbots, and more.

#### Embedding

Embedding is a method of representing data (such as text) in vector form. This representation ensures that data similar in certain specific aspects are close to each other in vector space, while unrelated data are farther apart. By converting text strings into vectors, the data can be effectively used in applications such as search, clustering, recommendation systems, anomaly detection, and classification.

#### Token

A token is the basic unit used by the model to represent natural language text, which can be intuitively understood as a “character” or “word.” Typically, one Chinese word, one English word, one number, or one symbol is counted as one token.

In general, the conversion ratio of tokens to characters in the ChatGLM series models is about 1:1.6. However, due to different tokenization methods in different models, the conversion ratio may vary. The actual number of tokens processed each time is determined by the model’s response, which you can view in the usage field of the returned results.
