# Account Subject Change Agreement

Before you formally submit an application for account subject change, please read this agreement carefully. The agreement will prompt you to pay special attention to clauses that will have a significant impact on your rights and obligations through bold or \* formatting. If you have any questions about the terms of this agreement, please consult the Large Model Open Platform. If you disagree with the content of this agreement or cannot accurately understand the interpretation of the terms by the Large Model Open Platform, please do not proceed with any further actions.

By directly confirming, accepting the content linked to on this page and indicating compliance, signing a written agreement, or other methods recognized by the Large Model Open Platform, or by other methods recognized by laws, regulations, or customs, you indicate that you have reached an agreement with the Large Model Open Platform and agree to accept all the provisions of this agreement. From the effective date as stipulated in this agreement, this agreement is legally binding on you.

**Please ensure that you accept this agreement and are confident that the account subject change will achieve your intended purpose, and that you can accept the consequences and responsibilities related to this change before proceeding with any further actions.**

## 1. Agreement Subject, Content, and Effectiveness

1.1 This agreement is between the account holder (“you”, “original subject”) of a specific Large Model Open Platform account and Beijing Zhipu Huazhang Technology Co., Ltd. (“Zhipu Technology”) regarding your application to transfer the rights and obligations under the “Large Model Open Platform Website Service Terms” (“Account Agreement”) previously agreed upon between the parties for the account subject change application to a third party, and related matters.

1.2 **This agreement is a conditional agreement that only becomes legally effective when the following three conditions are met simultaneously:**

* The Large Model Open Platform account you are applying to change has completed real-name authentication, and you are the subject of this real-name authentication;
* The Large Model Open Platform reviews and agrees to your account subject change application;
* You apply to transfer the rights and obligations under the Account Agreement to a third party (“new subject”), who agrees to accept the account subject change in accordance with the “Acceptance of Account Subject Change Agreement”.

1.3 **You and the new subject shall separately agree on the transfer of all products, services, funds, credits, debts, etc. (collectively referred to as “account resources”) under the account. However, if the agreement between you and the new subject conflicts with the provisions of this agreement, the provisions of this agreement shall prevail.**

## 2. Definitions and Interpretations

2.1 “Large Model Open Platform Official Website”: Refers to the website with the domain name maas.aminer.cn.

If the user’s information differs from the real-name authentication subject information, the real-name authentication information shall prevail; for accounts that have not completed real-name authentication, the Large Model Open Platform will determine the account holder based on the user’s information and other relevant factors.

2.5 “Account Real-name Authentication Subject Change”: Refers to the change of the real-name authentication subject (original subject) of a Large Model Open Platform account to another real-name authentication subject (new subject), referred to as “account subject change” in this agreement.

2.6 **The “account subject change” procedure and consequences under this agreement apply only to the real-name authentication subject change of a Large Model Open Platform account initiated by the original subject and accepted by the new subject.**

* **The Large Model Open Platform has the right to refuse your request to revoke the account subject change based on disputes with the new subject or for other reasons;**
* **The Large Model Open Platform has the right to take corresponding measures to ensure that the new subject obtains the actual management rights of the account in the event of disputes or conflicts between you and the new subject regarding account management rights.**
