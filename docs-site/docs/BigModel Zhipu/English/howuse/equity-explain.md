# User Benefits

Developers can enhance their user rights level by earning points. Based on the user rights level, they can enjoy 8 types of platform benefits, including model billing discounts, Zhipu new product experiences, and Zhipu platform services.

## Earning User Benefits Points

Developers can earn points by consuming their account balance (including calling model API interfaces, model training, model deployment, etc.) and purchasing product resource packages. The amount spent is exchanged for points on a one-to-one basis.

Please note that the balance consumed from bonus accounts will not be converted into points. If a user initiates a refund, the points will correspondingly change. For example, after a refund occurs, the points will be reduced by the refund amount in the month of the refund.

## User Benefits Usage

When developers upgrade their user rights level, they will receive discounts on real-time model inference (excluding Batch inference), model training, and deployment. Additionally, the concurrency of official models for real-time inference will be correspondingly increased. The applicable models and specific discounts can be viewed through [the current benefits level](https://bigmodel.cn/usercenter/corporateequity)  .

## User Benefits Level Calculation Rules

The relationship between levels and point ranges is as follows:

| Level | Point Range |
| --- | --- |
| V0 | [ 0 , 2,000 ) |
| V1 | [ 2,000 , 10,000 ) |
| V2 | [ 10,000 , 50,000 ) |
| V3 | >= 50,000 |

We will update the points at 06:00:00 on the t+1 day, and determine your user rights level for this month based on your highest points in the past three months. This month, you will enjoy various corresponding rights based on your user rights level. When you start enjoying discount benefits, we will calculate the points based on the amount before the discount. For example, when you get a 10% discount during real-time inference and spend 90 yuan, the points will be recorded as 100 points based on the 100 yuan before the discount, to avoid a decrease in points due to the discount. (Note: Points for batch inference are calculated based on the actual amount deducted.)

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### User Rights Logic Effective Time?

This logic will take effect from 22:00 on the evening of April 7, 2025.

#### How can I check my points and user benefit level?

You can view your points and corporate benefit level at [User Benefits](https://bigmodel.cn/usercenter/corporateequity) .

#### Will consuming tokens from a resource pack increase my points?

No, only by consuming cash balances and using real-time billing to call model APIs can points be earned. When you have a token resource pack, it will be consumed first, and no points will be earned during this process.

#### Will using Batch API increase my points?

If the consumption during Batch API calls is from the cash balance (excluding bonus funds), points will be accumulated. However, the discount after user rights upgrade does not apply to Batch API.

#### What is the priority of taking effect between tiered pricing and user benefits?

If a reasoning model is configured with tiered pricing, it will take effect based on the logic of tiered pricing. The discount ratio of user benefits does not actually take effect on the model configured with tiered pricing.
