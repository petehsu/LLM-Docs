# GLM-4.1V-Thinking

The GLM-4.1V-Thinking series is the most powerful visual reasoning model known at the 10B parameter scale. It achieves new state-of-the-art performance in key areas such as chart and video understanding, front-end coding, and GUI tasks. By introducing a chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism, it significantly enhances accuracy and interpretability in complex scenarios.

## **Detailed Description**

1. **Achieves SOTA across multiple vision-language benchmarks**

The GLM-4.1V-Thinking model achieves breakthrough performance while maintaining efficient deployment. **In 28 authoritative benchmarks—including MMStar, MMMU-Pro, ChartQAPro, and ​**​**OSWorld—it**​​**​ secured top scores among 10B-scale models in 23 tasks. Remarkably, it matched or outperformed mainstream VLMs with 8 times more parameters in 18 of those benchmarks**​, demonstrating the extreme performance potential of compact models.  
![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1751371876183image.png?attname=image.png)

Notably, the model demonstrates exceptional adaptability in recommendation-related tasks, with its high generality and robustness standing out in complex business scenarios.

2. **​ Leading reasoning capabilities**

Built upon the GLM-4V architecture, GLM-4.1V-Thinking introduces a **chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism** and adopts a curriculum sampling reinforcement learning strategy, systematically enhancing the model’s cross-modal causal reasoning capabilities and stability. With its strengthened reasoning abilities, GLM-4.1V-Thinking demonstrates significantly improved problem-solving performance in complex real-world applications such as scientific research, education, autonomous agents, and multimodal assistants.

## **User Concurrency Rights**

API calls are subject to rate limits. Currently, we limit the number of concurrent requests (the number of in-flight request tasks). The concurrency guarantees for different user tiers are as follows.

| Model version | V0 | V1 | V2 | V3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GLM-4.1V-Thinking-Flash | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 |
| GLM-4.1V-Thinking-FlashX | 30 | 50 | 80 | 100 |
