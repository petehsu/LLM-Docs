## **GLM-4-Plus**

**GLM-4-Plus is the most advanced and intelligent flagship model available on the Zhipu BigModel open platform to date.** It leads globally in areas such as language understanding, logical reasoning, instruction following, and long-text processing.

| **Price** | **Input Modality** | **Output Modality** | **Context Window** | **Maximum Output Tokens** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5 RMB per million tokens | Text | Text | 128K | 4K |

### **Recommended Use Cases**

1. **Translation:** In addition to multilingual translation, it can accurately handle texts with mixed languages, tones, slang, emojis, and technical terms, while also respecting cultural nuances.
2. **Intelligent Data Classification:** Based on semantic understanding, it can automatically classify and label complex heterogeneous data with high precision. It can design multi-dimensional evaluation metrics based on business objectives and use model validation to ensure the reliability of the results.
3. **Document Information Extraction:** Capable of comprehending and analyzing massive amounts of text, it can accurately extract structured fields such as project numbers and amounts, with an average accuracy rate of over 93%. By combining domain-specific expert prompts, it can also semantically infer and classify complex clauses.
4. **Hit Content Creation:** Quickly generates diverse, stylistically consistent, and attractive high-quality copy, covering social media posts, advertising slogans, product detail pages, marketing emails, and key event descriptions. (Recommended to combine with [search tools](https://www.bigmodel.cn/dev/howuse/websearch)  for more real-time, accurate, and high-quality results)
5. **Risk Assessment Reports:** Rapidly analyzes vast amounts of the latest industry data, policy documents, and market trends to identify potential risks, automatically producing risk assessment reports that meet business needs, efficiently completing risk classification and strategy ormulation. (Recommended to combine with [search tools](https://www.bigmodel.cn/dev/howuse/websearch) for more real-time, accurate, and high-quality results)
6. **Smart Itinerary Planning:** Tailors travel plans to user preferences, budget requirements, and time constraints by integrating information such as transportation, weather, and accommodation costs, creating personalized itineraries covering transportation connections, accommodations, and sightseeing. (Recommended to combine with [search tools](https://www.bigmodel.cn/dev/howuse/websearch)  for more real-time, accurate, and high-quality results)

### **Detailed Description**

GLM-4-Plus serves as the robust foundation of the entire Zhipu model family, achieving significant performance improvements and cost reductions in areas such as code computation, data analysis, and image/video feature recognition.

1. #### **Language Capabilities**

GLM-4-Plus uses extensive model-assisted high-quality synthetic data to improve performance and employs PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) to enhance reasoning tasks (math, code, etc.), aligning more closely with human preferences. In comparative testing with OpenAI GPT-4o, GLM-4-Plus achieves near or even better performance on most tasks.

| Models | AlignBench | MMLU | MATH | GPQA | LCB | NCB | IFEval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | 80.7 | 88.3 | 71.1 | \*56.4 | 49.8 | 53.1 | 80.6 |
| Llama 3.1 405B | 60.7 | 88.6 | 73.8 | \*50.1 | \*39.4 | 50 | 83.9 |
| Gemini 1.5Pro | 74.7 | 85.9 | 67.7 | 46.2 | 33.6 | 42.3 | 74.4 |
| GPT-4o | 83.8 | 88.7 | 76.6 | \*51.0 | \*45.5 | 52.3 | 81.9 |
| GLM-4-Plus | 83.2 | 86.8 | 74.2 | 50.7 | \*45.8 | 50.4 | 79.5 |
| GLM-4-Plus/GPT-4o | 99% | 98% | 97% | 99% | 101% | 96% | 97% |
| GLM-4-Plus/Claude 3.5 Sonnet | 103% | 98% | 104% | 85% | 92% | 95% | 99% |

During its release period, GLM-4-Plus ranked among the world’s top three in the SuperBench large model evaluation.

2. #### **Long-Text Capabilities**

In long-text processing, GLM-4-Plus uses a more precise mix of long and short text data, significantly enhancing reasoning performance and improving understanding and processing of lengthy texts. This greatly mitigates the performance drop caused by excessive prompts in enterprise deployment scenarios.

| Models | LongBench-Chat | InfiniteBench/EN.MC | Ruler |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mistral-123B | 8.2 | 38.9 | 80.5 |
| Llama 405B | 8.6 | 83.4 | 91.5 |
| Claude Sonnet 3.5 | 8.6 | 79.5 | - |
| Gemini 1.5 Pro | 8.6 | 80.9 | 95.8 |
| GPT-4o | 9 | 82.5 | - |
| GLM-4-Plus | 8.8 | 85.1 | 93 |
| GLM-4-Plus/GPT-4o | 98% | 103% | - |
| GLM-4-Plus/Claude 3.5 Sonnet | 102% | 107% | - |
