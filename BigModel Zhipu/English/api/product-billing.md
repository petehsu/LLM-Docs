# Product Billing

## Billing Overview

#### 1. Billing Units

| Billing Unit | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| token | A token is the basic unit used by the model to represent natural language text, which can be intuitively understood as a “character” or “word”; typically, 1 Chinese word, 1 English word, 1 number, or 1 symbol counts as 1 token. |

Under normal circumstances, the conversion ratio between tokens and character count in the ChatGLM model is approximately 1:1.6. However, due to different tokenization methods in different models, the conversion ratio may vary. The actual number of tokens processed each time is subject to the model’s return, which you can check from the usage in the return results.

#### 2. Billing Scope

We will measure and bill based on the total number of tokens in both the model’s input and output (vector large model embedding-2 is billed only by the number of input tokens, and image large models are billed by the number of calls). If you enable tool invocation, the invocation results will also be measured and billed as input.

It is important to note that if you experience a designated model in the experience center, the charging rules are consistent with API calls.

#### 3. Deduction Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Fee Deduction | Deduction amount = token usage x model unit price, corresponding fees will be deducted from your recharge account and/or bonus account (if you have balances in multiple accounts, we will deduct proportionally; for example, if the fee is 10 yuan, then 5 yuan will be deducted from both the recharge and bonus accounts) |
| Resource Pack Deduction | Deduction quantity = token usage, corresponding quota will be deducted from your resource pack account (unless otherwise specified in the purchase notes on the resource pack purchase page, we will default to deducting from the resource pack account first when it has a balance, then from the recharge/bonus account) |
