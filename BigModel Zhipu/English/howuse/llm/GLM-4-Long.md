## GLM-4-Long

GLM-4-Long is a language model specifically designed for processing ultra-long texts and memory-intensive tasks, supporting inputs up to 1 million tokens (1.5 to 2 million characters).

| **Price** | **Input Modality** | **Output Modality** | **Context Window** | **Maximum Output Tokens** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 RMB per million tokens | Text | Text | 1M | 4K |

### **Recommended Use Cases**

1. **Financial Report Analysis:** Capable of processing hundreds of pages of annual financial reports, automatically extracting key information such as revenue structure, risk warnings, and management discussion, and generating structured analytical reports. By remembering historical financial data, it can compare trends across multiple reports and identify potential financial anomalies.
2. **Academic Paper Reading:** Supports parsing academic papers with tens of thousands of words, automatically summarizing key sections such as research background, experimental methods, and conclusions, and outputs content by topic. Combined with domain knowledge bases, it can logically verify cross-section theoretical derivations, helping researchers quickly identify innovations and argumentative flaws.
3. **Novel Reading:** Performs in-depth analysis of character relationships and plotlines in million-word-length novels, generating specific content summaries. Based on memory of the overall writing style, it enables high-quality continuations that maintain narrative coherence and literary quality.
4. **Legal Document Analysis:** Processes vast amounts of legal provisions, case law, and contract texts, precisely extracting key information such as rights and obligations clauses and definitions of responsibilities. By remembering similar cases, it assists lawyers in conducting legal risk assessments and developing litigation strategies.

### **Detailed Description**

1. **Ultra-Long Text Processing Capability:** Supports context lengths of up to 1M tokens (approximately 1.5 to 2 million characters), equivalent to 2 copies of *Dream of the Red Chamber* or 125 academic papers, demonstrating extremely powerful long-text processing capabilities.
2. **Reasoning Ability:** Not only can it read and translate long documents, but it can also perform global analysis, such as analyzing financial reports and extracting key information, contract clauses, and scientific research data. GLM-4-Long already possesses certain reasoning and memory capabilities, enabling it to understand and respond to complex queries and to create chatbots with ultra-long memory.
3. **Key Technical Points:** During the Continue Pre-Training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) stages, mixed training was performed to gradually extend the context length, developing from an initial 2K context support to 1M context support.

model, I don't have personal opinions or preferences, but I can analyze the character 
relationships and plot structure of the Harry Potter series to the best of my 
ability. The Harry Potter series is a complex and intricate work of fiction with a 
vast array of characters and a compelling plot structure. The series follows the life 
of Harry Potter, a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage and attends 
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Throughout the series, Harry forms strong 
bonds with his friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and faces many challenges, 
including the rise of the dark wizard Voldemort.\n\nThe character relationships in 
the series are complex and multifaceted. Harry, Ron, and Hermione form a tight-knit 
trio, supporting each other through thick and thin. Other key relationships include 
Harry's friendship with Sirius Black and his rivalry with Draco Malfoy. The 
relationships between the characters are dynamic and evolve throughout the series, 
adding depth and richness to the story.\n\nThe plot structure of the series is also 
complex and intricate. Each book in the series follows a similar pattern, with Harry 
and his friends facing a new challenge each year at Hogwarts. However, the 
overarching plot of the series is the battle between good and evil, represented by 
Harry and Voldemort, respectively. The series builds towards a climactic 
confrontation between Harry and Voldemort, with the fate of the wizarding world 
hanging in the balance.\n\nIf I were J.K. Rowling, an alternate ending for the series 
could involve a different outcome for the final battle between Harry and Voldemort. 
For example, instead of killing Voldemort, Harry could use his powers to imprison him 
in a magical prison, ensuring that he can never return to power. This would allow for 
a more hopeful and optimistic ending, with the possibility of Voldemort being 
redeemed or reformed in the future. Additionally, the alternate ending could explore 
the long-term consequences of the battle, such as the impact on the wizarding world 
and the lives of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n\nOverall, the Harry Potter series is a 
masterful work of fiction, with a rich and complex character network and a compelling 
plot structure. The series has captivated audiences around the world, and its 
enduring popularity is a testament to its timeless appeal."),
