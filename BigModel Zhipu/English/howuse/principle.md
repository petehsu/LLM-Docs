* **Existence Value of AI**: Teaching people to learn, enabling human growth, rather than surpassing or replacing humans
* **Ultimate Ideal of AI**: Bringing more freedom and possibilities to humanity

## II. Establishing Action Guidelines for AI Technology Development

* **Safety and Controllability**: Highly attentive to the safety of artificial intelligence systems, ensuring auditability, supervisability, traceability, and trustworthiness.
* **Fairness and Justice**: Promoting fairness and justice by continuously improving technical levels and management methods, striving to eliminate biases and discrimination in data acquisition, algorithm design, technology development, product research and development, and application processes.
* **Enhancing Human Welfare**: Promoting harmony between humans and machines, serving the progress of human civilization; with the premise of ensuring social security and respecting human rights.

## III. Continuous Improvement of AI Technology Management Standards

* **Respect for Privacy**: Respecting and protecting personal privacy, fully safeguarding individuals’ right to know and choose.
* **Compliance and Self-Discipline**: Always maintaining a high sense of social responsibility and self-discipline, strictly adhering to laws, regulations, ethical codes, and industry standards, while actively complying with updates to national regulations and standards, ensuring the legality and compliance of new artificial intelligence technologies.
* **Agile Governance**: Respecting the development laws of artificial intelligence, while promoting innovation and orderly development, promptly identifying and addressing potential risks. Continuously improving intelligent technical means, optimizing management mechanisms, and perfecting governance systems, promoting governance principles throughout the entire lifecycle of artificial intelligence products and services. Conducting ongoing research and forecasting potential risks of more advanced artificial intelligence in the future, ensuring that artificial intelligence always develops in a direction beneficial to humanity.

## IV. Ongoing Exploration of Risk Control Measures for AI Technology

In conjunction with national laws, regulations, and relevant standards, conducting assessments before releasing new artificial intelligence technologies and adopting corresponding risk control measures based on specific circumstances, such as:

* **Technical Measures**: Complying with requirements of laws such as the Cybersecurity Law for log retention, identity authentication, development of detection tools, etc.
* **Management Measures**: Applying for approval or reporting to relevant regulatory authorities in accordance with legal requirements before the release of specific technologies; signing relevant agreements with developers of artificial intelligence open platforms, actively reminding developers of their usage behavior, etc.
