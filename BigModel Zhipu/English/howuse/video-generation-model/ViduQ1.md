## Vidu Q1

Vidu**​ ​**Q1 is the next-generation video generation model from Vidu, designed for high-quality video creation. It consistently outputs 5-second, 24-frame, 1080P video clips. Through advanced optimization of visual clarity, Vidu Q1 delivers significantly enhanced image quality with notable improvements in issues such as hand distortion and frame jitter. The model achieves photorealistic rendering that closely resembles real-world scenes, while maintaining stylistic accuracy in 2D animation. Transitions between the first and last frames are exceptionally smooth, making Vidu Q1 well-suited for demanding creative applications in film, advertising, and animated short productions.

| **Model Version** | **Capabilities** | **Duration** | **Resolution** | **Price** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| viduq1-image | Image-to-Video Generation | 5s | 1080p | 2.5 RMB per use |
| viduq1-start-end | Start and End Frame | 5s | 1080p | 2.5 RMB per use |
| viduq1-text | Text-to-Video Generation | 5s | 1080p | 2.5 RMB per use |

### **Capability Description**

* ​**Image-to-Video Generation**​: Generate a video by providing a starting frame or both starting and ending frames along with corresponding text descriptions.
* ​**Start and End Frame**​: Supports input of two images: the first uploaded image is treated as the starting frame, and the second as the ending frame. The model uses these images as input parameters to generate the video.
* ​**Text-to-Video Generation**​: Generate a video from a text prompt; currently supports both a general style and an anime style optimized for animation.

Note: The URL link for the video generated by the model is valid for one day. Please save it as soon as possible if needed.

### **Recommended Use Cases**

### **Detailed Description**

1. #### Cinematic-Level Visual Clarity

The model delivers a comprehensive upgrade in visual detail restoration.  
[](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/static/platform/videos/usage-guide/vidu/q1-1.mp4)

2. #### Precise Resolution of Visual Artifacts

Movements are smooth and natural—hand gestures during product demonstrations in e-commerce livestreams are accurately rendered and compliant. Visual jitter is minimized through dynamic frame interpolation technology, ensuring fluid and stable footage even in motion-heavy scenes such as running shots or vehicle perspectives.

3. #### Multi-Style Artistic Expression

The realistic style aims for lifelike visuals—urban landscapes and character portraits in city promos are rendered with striking realism. The animated style focuses on authenticity, accurately capturing everything from the hand-drawn lines of Japanese anime to the saturated colors of Western cartoons. By inputting anime character designs, the model generates dynamic story segments that closely match the original IP’s visual style, boosting the efficiency of derivative content creation.

4. #### Industry-Leading Transition Smoothness

The start-to-end frame transition technology reaches a new level, using dynamic frame prediction and style fusion algorithms to overcome the limitations of “mechanical stitching” in video transitions.
