3. In the pop-up box, you can choose to turn it on or off at the “Auto Configuration” in the upper right corner, and the default state is on.

![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972323673image.png?attname=image.png)

### 4.2 Fundamental Variable

The agent you create usually has four initial variables, which are `{{conversation record}}`, `{{user-conversation}}`, `{{LLM}}/{{Agent}}`, and `{{current time}}`.

![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1732005247733image.png?attname=image.png)

* **Conversation record**: This variable refers to the historical conversation record between you and the agent.
* **{{User-Dialogue}}**: This variable refers to the input of the user’s current round.
* **{{LLM}}/{{Agent}}**: This variable refers to the output of the LLM node or Agent node you added.
* **{{Current time}}**: The current Beijing time automatically obtained by the system, is used to inform the large model of the current time.

### 4.3 Start Node

Click the button next to the “Start” node to enter the dialogue settings, as shown in the figure.

![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972345485image.png?attname=image.png)  
![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972353292image.png?attname=image.png)

* **The start node is the start node**: Every time the user enters something, it is executed from the start node of the process canvas.
* **The starting node is the last conversation node**: Each time the user enters content, the conversation continues with the user from the node in the last conversation (Agent node only).
* **Dialogue history strategy (carrying the number of rounds of context)**: Controls the variable `{dialogue record}`, the LLM node’s “historical dialogue splicing” function, and the Agent node’s “historical dialogue” round.

### 4.4 Agent Node

![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972363360image.png?attname=image.png)

**Function Introduction**: You can use Agent nodes to enrich your own intelligent agent functions.

* **Prompt text box**: Edit the Prompt area, the default is system prompt. Advanced mode after full screen supports entering System Prompt and User Prompt separately. Click the lower right corner of the Prompt text box to enter full-screen mode, and enter advanced mode in the upper left corner.

![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972382280image.png?attname=image.png)  
![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972391496image.png?attname=image.png)

* **System Prompt**: In large models, System Prompt usually refers to instructions or context designed by model developers or users to guide model behavior.
* **User Prompt**: User Prompt refers to the text input by the user, which is the direct input for the user request model to generate responses.
* **Prompt optimization**: After you have preliminarily written your Prompt, you can click on the star symbol on the right side of Advanced and use the Prompt optimization function to optimize your Prompt to save time on Prompt writing and achieve better results.

![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972401904image.png?attname=image.png)

**Model settings**: The model setup page supports replacing large models with a single set of nodes. You can debug the optimal solution for cost and effect in your business scenario by configuring large models with different parameters.  
The model settings page supports adjusting temperature, top\_p, and max\_token three parameters.

* **Temperature:** The Temperature parameter mainly controls the randomness of the text generated by the model. When the Temperature value is high, the model tends to generate more diverse and innovative text, but this may also introduce grammatical errors or irrelevant content. Conversely, when the Temperature value is low, the text generated by the model will be more conservative and stable, but may lack diversity and creativity.
* **Top\_P:** The Top-p (kernel sampling) parameter is different from the Temperature parameter in that it affects diversity by limiting the range of candidate words for the generated text. The Top-p parameter indicates that only the highest probability p% of candidate words are considered when generating each word. Therefore, when the p-value is high, the model-generated text will be more diverse and innovative, but may also contain some unrelated words. When the p-value is low, the generated text will be more focused and coherent, but may lack novelty.
* **Max\_token:** Control model maximum output token, the range is 1-8192.  
  ![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972570523image.png?attname=image.png)  
  Support glm-4-alltools model, now glm-4-alltools model can generate and run code locally (code interpreter)  
  ![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972585629image.png?attname=image.png)
* **Tools**: unique features of Agent nodes that help your agent create richer features.

  + **Plugin**: By calling functions, Agent nodes can interact with other systems and support calling external interfaces.

![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972624887image.png?attname=image.png)

* **Use plugins**: You can add plugins built into the Agent Center by clicking “Tools - Add Plugins”.
* **Create plugins**: You can configure your own plugins through “Tools - Add Plugins - Custom Plugins”.

![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972615049image.png?attname=image.png)

**Steps**:

1. Configure your authentication (if any).
2. Configure the schema according to the given example (input the corresponding API schema that conforms to the OpenAPI 3.0 specification), and synchronize support for YAMA and JSON formats.
3. Verify if the analysis result on the right is correct.
4. Save the plugin.

![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972671675image.png?attname=image.png)

* **Plugins - Variables/Memory**: A tool to assist large models in achieving long-term memory. The function of this tool is to record data in Key-value format and convert it into variables, which can be used for global reference.

![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972697905image.png?attname=image.png)  
**How to use**:

* Agent node usage: Like other plug-in tools, it is called by the Agent itself. For debugging and optimization steps, in addition to Prompt, you can pay attention to the field description of the plug-in function itself.

**Use tips:**

If you need to implement reading variables:

```
已有变量：
城市：北京

需求：
大模型读取现在已有城市

示例指令：
当前已有城市：{城市}}
```

1  
2  
3  
4  
5  
6  
7  
8

If you need to store multiple values in a variable:

* First, introduce the variable into the instruction so that the large model can see the existing value in the variable.
* Then adjust the instructions so that when the large model is written, it will include not only the newly added value, but also the existing value.

```
已有变量：
城市：北京

需求：
增加上海

示例指令：
除了当前已有的城市，我还想去上海
当前已有城市：{城市}}，多个值之间采用逗号隔开

结果：
城市：北京，上海
```

1  
2  
3  
4  
5  
6  
7  
8  
9  
10  
11  
12

**Knowledge Base:** Agent nodes can access your Knowledge Base on the development platform by calling functions, and have the ability to recognize user intentions on their own. Agents can independently “rewrite user input” and use questions that are more in line with user intentions to find corresponding answers in the Knowledge Base.

1. Since the Agent node calls Knowledge Base through a function call, the name and description of Knowledge Base will be input to the model as the name and description of the function, which affects the final effect of the large model calling the function. Please configure the name and description carefully.
2. You can add your Knowledge Base on Open Platform by clicking “Tools - Add Knowledge Base”.
3. After adding Knowledge Base, you will find a settings button next to the add button. After clicking it, you can make advanced settings to the Knowledge Base function. In the manual settings, you can adjust the recall strategy of Knowledge Base.  
   a. Currently supports three methods: Search Deep Retrieval, keyword recall, and mixed recall.  
   b. Support the Rerank model to improve the relevance and accuracy of search results by reordering the results.  
   c. Support manual setting for recalling slices.  
   d. Support manually setting search terms for knowledge.  
   ![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972719805image.png?attname=image.png)  
   ![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972731510image.png?attname=image.png)  
   ![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972738607image.png?attname=image.png)

* **Auxiliary Capability - Network Search**: The Agent node supports network search capability and supports configuring search terms. This function is not implemented through function calls.  
  1. Internet Settings: With Internet Search enabled, you can click the Settings button on the right side of the “Internet Search Switch” to open the Internet Settings box and configure search terms.  
  2. When the search term is not empty, the Agent node will force a search in each round of dialogue.  
  ![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972748194image.png?attname=image.png)
* **Jump-in condition**: The agent node can automatically recognize the user’s intention for node jump. You can fill in the scenarios or tasks applicable to the agent in the “Jump-in condition”.

  1. You can describe in detail the types of questions the agent is responsible for answering, the tasks it performs, or just the scenarios you want it to be used in.
  2. The influence range of the jump condition is global, which means that the agent can freely jump throughout the entire canvas.
* **Jump-out condition**: When the control agent node meets the condition, it jumps to the next node. There are currently two judgment conditions: model autonomous judgment and rule judgment.

  1. Model autonomous judgment: The model subjectively judges whether the current node can jump to the next node based on the intention of the dialogue.
  2. Rule judgment: Determine whether to jump to the next node based on objective conditions such as the number of dialogue rounds and time. This applies to general user training, dialogue practice, and other scenarios.

### 4.5 LLM Node

![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972760476image.png?attname=image.png)

**Function Introduction**: LLM nodes are used to execute specific user tasks, and the execution order is completely executed according to the canvas connection. The Agent Center supports parallel multiple LLM nodes.

* **Prompt text box**: Edit the Prompt area, the default is user prompt. Advanced mode after full screen supports entering System Prompt and User Prompt separately.
* **Prompt optimization**: After you have preliminarily written your Prompt, you can click on the star symbol on the right side of Advanced and use the Prompt optimization function to optimize your Prompt to save time on Prompt writing and achieve better results.
* **Model Settings**: The model setup page supports replacing large models with a single set of nodes. You can debug the optimal solution for cost and effect in your business scenario by configuring large models with different parameters.

  The model setup page supports replacing large models with a single set of nodes. You can debug the optimal solution for cost and effect in your business scenario by configuring large models with different parameters.

  The model settings page supports adjusting temperature, top\_p, and max\_token three parameters:

  + **Temperature:** The Temperature parameter mainly controls the randomness of the text generated by the model. When the Temperature value is high, the model tends to generate more diverse and innovative text. Conversely, when the Temperature value is low, the text generated by the model will be more conservative and stable.
  + **Top\_P:** The Top-p (kernel sampling) parameter is different from the Temperature parameter in that it affects diversity by limiting the range of candidate words for the generated text.

When the p-value is low, the generated text will be more focused and coherent, but may lack novelty.
  + **Max\_token:** Control model maximum output token, the range is 1-8192.

Support the “historical dialogue splicing” function. After enabling it, the LLM node will splice historical dialogue content. The specific dialogue round can be set in the start node.

![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972785065image.png?attname=image.png)

Support glm-4-alltools model, now glm-4-alltools model can generate and run code locally (code interpreter)

![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1730972826927image.png?attname=image.png)

**Tools**: LLM nodes can use two general abilities, Knowledge Base and Network Search. Unlike Agent nodes, the Knowledge Base of LLM nodes is not implemented through function calls. (PS: Currently, LLM nodes of text-based agents do not support Knowledge Base).

* **Knowledge Base:** LLM nodes support access to your Knowledge Base on the development platform. When you configure the Knowledge Base tool, the LLM node will definitely call the Knowledge Base tool when executed.
  + You can add your Knowledge Base in Open Platform by clicking “Tools - Add Knowledge Base”.
  + After adding Knowledge Base, you will find a settings button next to the add button. After clicking it, you can make advanced settings to the Knowledge Base function. In the manual settings, you can adjust the recall strategy of Knowledge Base. Currently, there are two ways to recall: index recall, original text recall, and mixed recall.
* Assistive Capability - Network Search: LLM nodes support network search capability and support configuring search terms. This function is not achieved through function calls.
  1. Internet Settings: With Internet Search enabled, you can click the Settings button on the right side of the “Internet Search Switch” to open the Internet Settings box and configure search terms.
  2. When the search term is not empty, the LLM node will force a search in each round of dialogue.  
     g.Jump condition : Agent can jump into the corresponding LLM node according to the intention.

**Or" conditional judgment function**: The branch judgment node can determine the branch direction based on the content and variable values output by the previous node. You can increase the branch judgment by using the “+” in the upper right corner. Currently, six branch judgment logics are supported: “equal to”, “not equal to”, “word count greater than”, “word count less than”, “empty”, “not empty”, “contain”, “do not contain”, “greater than”, “less than”. The conditional content can choose to reference variables or fixed values.

**And" conditional judgment function**:

1. When users need to determine the direction of a branch through multiple conditions (i.e. scenarios with “and” condition requirements), they can click “+ Add” in the condition to add judgment conditions under the same condition.

![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1731050647564image.png?attname=image.png)

2. When multiple branches in the canvas need to go to the same “branch judgment node”, you can connect multiple previous nodes to the “branch judgment node”.  
   ![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1731050701182image.png?attname=image.png)
3. “Otherwise” function: The “Otherwise” function of the branch judgment node can help you deal with unconventional situations encountered in the scene, such as the unstable output of the previous node.  
   ![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1731050743323image.png?attname=image.png)
4. Parallel execution function : The branch judgment node supports executing multiple branches at the same time. Under this function, if the judgment result meets the conditions of multiple branches at the same time, it is allowed to execute multiple subsequent branches at the same time

### 4.10 Tool Node

![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1731051592059image.png?attname=image.png)

* **Function Introduction：** Stably call the node of the third-party interface through the project. Now, by combining tool nodes, LLM nodes can also call tools. Currently, only the third-party tools provided by the platform are supported. The tool node cannot be used alone as the last node of the agent. It is necessary to add an LLM node after the tool receives the data returned by the tool and outputs it according to the user’s expectations.
* **How to use**:

  1. Select Add tool node.  
     ![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1731051675060image.png?attname=image.png)
  2. Select the required tool, add the corresponding action, and save it. See Agent node - Tools - Plugins for details.  
     ![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1731051695709image.png?attname=image.png)
  3. After adding, you can see the specific tool node, expand “input” to see the necessary imported parameters of the tool, you can choose to fill in fixed values or reference variables in the canvas;  
     ![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1731051735721image.png?attname=image.png)
  4. Click the Run icon in the upper right corner to bring up the tool debugging interface, where you can debug the tool on a single node.  
     ![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1731051761500image.png?attname=image.png)
  5. Expand “Output” to see the output paradigm of the tool node. The output paradigm of different tools is different.  
     ![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1731051793453image.png?attname=image.png)

**Plugins - Variables/Memory**:  
![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1731051915652image.png?attname=image.png)

* Function Introduction : A tool to assist large models in achieving long-term memory. See “Agent Node-Tools-Plugins-Plugins-Variables/Memory” for details.
* Usage : When using the tool node to add this function, the function is called in the form of a project. “Input-Body” is a pre-set variable name that can be selected as a fixed value or reference to variables in the agent. “Output” is the output paradigm of the tool. By clicking on “Variable Management” in the right area of “Input”, the variable interface can be called up to manage variables such as increase, decrease, and description.
  + Since the “tool-variable” node requires the input to be a structured data structure, it is necessary to make requirements for the output format of the preceding LLM node.
  + If there are multiple fields in the previous LLM node that need to be stored in multiple variables separately, “data extraction” is required to extract multiple fields from the LLM node first, and then reference them in order in the “input-body” section of “tool-variable”.
  + Since the “tool - variable” node is still the essence of the tool, so if as the last node of the agent, the execution result of the output tool (a piece of data in JSON format), the LLM node needs to be added after the tool to receive the data returned by the tool, and output according to the user’s expectations.  
    ![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1731052031807image.png?attname=image.png)  
    ![Description](https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/markdown/1731052048419image.png?attname=image.png)
  + Note: If there are multiple fields in the previous LLM node and they need to be stored in multiple variables separately, “Data Extraction” is required to extract multiple fields from the LLM node first, and then reference them in order in the “Input-Body” section of “Tools-Variables”, as shown in the following figure.

### 8.1.1 Prompt Writing Tips

Writing prompts is an important step in configuring applications. The clearer and more specific the prompts are, the more expected the response will be. You can iterate the prompts based on the actual performance of the application to optimize the performance of the large model.

In order to achieve a better experience for the application, it is recommended to include and pay attention to the following content in the writing instructions:

**Recommendations**:

1. **Set the Role**: Describe the role or responsibilities of the application, as well as the style of its responses.
2. **Describe Functionality and Workflow**: Explain the application’s functions and workflow, specifying how it should respond to users in different scenarios. Emphasize in natural language the scenarios in which a particular tool should be invoked to enhance the application’s constraints and ensure the selection of tools that align with expected outcomes for accurate responses.
3. **Direct the Application to Respond Within a Specified Scope**: If you want to limit the scope of responses, explicitly tell the application what it should and should not answer. For example: Refuse to answer topics unrelated to healthy living. If no nutritional information about a particular food is found, inform the user that it was not found rather than fabricating content.
4. **For Applications with Relatively Complex Functions, It is Recommended to Use Structured Formatting for Prompts**: Structured prompts using Markdown syntax are more readable and impose stronger constraints on the application. You can use the prompt optimization feature, which automatically optimizes prompts into structured content. You can directly use the optimized content or modify it based on the optimized version.
