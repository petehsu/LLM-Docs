# Coding Plan Overview

> The Coding Plan is a subscription package designed for AI-powered coding

## Welcome to the Coding Plan!

The powerful performance of the **MiniMax M2** model is a key step in our mission to achieve "**Intelligence with Everyone**".

To provide a more developer-friendly and easy-to-use service, we are excited to introduce the **[Coding Plan](https://platform.minimax.io/subscribe/coding-plan)**. This monthly subscription service allows you to experience full-featured usage at just 1/10th the price of corresponding plans from providers like Claude.

This document will guide you on how to get started with the **[Coding Plan](https://platform.minimax.io/subscribe/coding-plan)** .

## Core Advantages

1. **Powered by the MiniMax M2 Model**

   All Coding Plan packages are equipped with the **MiniMax M2** model. This model is designed for Agent and Code, featuring an efficient architecture that leads to lower latency and highly competitive cost-effectiveness.

2. **Extremely Cost-Effective Subscription**

   The Coding Plan is tailored for high-frequency programming scenarios, offering a subscription with exceptional value. Instead of paying per token, a fixed subscription fee grants you a substantial number of prompts within your programming tools, allowing you to focus on coding without worrying about unpredictable bills.

## Using in AI Coding Tools

After obtaining your API Key, you need to configure it in your preferred AI coding tool.

For detailed setup instructions, please refer to our official documentation:

* [**AI Coding Tools Guide**](https://platform.minimax.io/docs/guides/text-ai-coding-tools)

Please select the configuration guide corresponding to the tool you use (e.g., Claude Code, Cursor, etc.).

## Subscription Plans & Usage Limits

We offer a variety of plans (**Starter**, **Plus**, **Max**) to meet the diverse needs of coding. As mentioned, all Coding Plan packages are powered by the formidable **MiniMax M2** model.

1 "prompt" is roughly equivalent to 15 requests to the model. Therefore, you get substantially more value compared to token-based billing. The actual consumption rate will be influenced by factors such as the complexity of your project, the size of your codebase, and whether you have features like auto-accept suggestions enabled.

## Reach the Usage Limit

When you reach the prompt limit within a 5-hours cycle, you have the following options:

1. **Switch to Pay-As-You-Go**:
   If you wish to continue without rate limits, you can replace the API Key in your coding tool with your standard API key from the MiniMax Open Platform account management system. This will switch the tool to a pay-as-you-go model based on actual token usage, which will consume your API account balance.
2. **Wait for the Reset**:
   The Coding Plan's limit is based on a rolling 5-hours window. You can simply pause usage, and as the window moves forward, your quota will automatically be restored.
