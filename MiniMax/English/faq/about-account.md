# About Account

> Find answers to common MiniMax account questions on billing, invoices, balance alerts, and resource management.

## Q: Founding account

**A:** We offer two ways to fund your account: **Online Payment** and **Bank Transfer**. You can find the entry buttons for both top-up methods within your [Account > Billing > Balance](https://platform.minimax.io/user-center/payment/balance). Please choose the method that best suits your needs.

## Q: Balance alert

**A:** To prevent business disruptions caused by an insufficient account balance, we recommend enabling the **balance alert** feature. You can set a balance threshold by navigating to [Account > Billing > Balance](https://platform.minimax.io/user-center/payment/balance). When your account balance falls below this threshold, the MiniMax Open Platform will notify you via email. Please monitor these notifications and top up your account in a timely manner.

## Q: Autobilling

**A:** We also offer an **Autobilling** feature to ensure your services run without interruption. You can enable and configure this feature under [Account > Billing > Balance](https://platform.minimax.io/user-center/payment/balance).

You can configure a balance threshold and payment method. When your account balance drops below this threshold, we will automatically top it up. If the payment fails, we will send you an email notification. This ensures your API requests will not fail due to an insufficient balance, preventing any service interruptions.

## Q: Delete account

**A:** If you no longer wish to use MiniMax's service, you can permanently delete your account.
