# Get Voice

> Use this API to list available voices by category.

This API allows you to query **all available voice IDs** (`voice_id`) under the **current account**.

This includes system voices, quick cloning voices, voices generated by the text-to-voice API, and human/accompaniment vocals generated by the music API.
